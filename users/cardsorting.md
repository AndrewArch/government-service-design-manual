Card sorting is a research method that is used to understand the way that the intended users of a web site naturally organise or think about different types of information content.  It draws on psychological theories of 'concepts and categories'.

##Guidance

The method is very simple to use: it involves simply writing the topics that will be covered on a website on pieces of card (maximum of around 50) and asking representative users to organise the topics into groups, and then to give each group a meaningful label.  This is an open card sort: it is also possible to conduct a closed card sort, whereby the users are given pre-determined categories and are asked to allocate each card to one of these categories.

Card sorts can also be conducted using an online tool such as [OptimalSort](http://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort.htm).  This is a cheap and effective way of reaching a large sample of users without needing to bring them into a dedicated lab facility for the study.

Where/how you might use it
Open card sorts are most suitable for identifying how users think about information, in order to build an information architecture.  Closed card sorts are most suitable for validating an information architecture.

##Weaknesses/when not to use

The analysis of card sorting can be difficult if no clear categories emerge.  It can also be difficult to conduct a card sort on a very large website with a broad scope of content (e.g. gov.uk) since the maximum number of cards may not be representative of all of the content.

##No./Types of participants

Representative of the target user group.  15 to 30 users: a minimum of 15 users to give reasonable confidence in the results, but any more than 30 gives diminishing returns.

##Cost

Recruitment costs if conducting a card sort in a lab environment.  For online card sorts, just the cost of the licence.  OptimalSort provides an 'on demand' monthly licence (Nick, what's the cost?)

##Timescales

A few days

##Examples

Initial activity for categorisation of gov.uk prelaunch, an online open card sort but it was difficult to represent the full scope of the content.
