##Discovery phase

# What is phase for?

Discover at a very high level what the service is for, which user needs it is intended to serve, and what we may need to deliver it

Use various techniques to gain understanding
- workshops
- simple mock ups / prototypes 
- whiteboard diagrams

Provide high level business context
-	service overview
-	key drivers & goals
-	constraints
-		technical, regulatory, legacy, cost etc
		
High level understanding of the service
-	high level user needs
-	sketch flows through service
-	sketch domain model
-	legacy interfaces
-	legacy to decommission
-	key metrics
 - number of users
 - number of transactions
	
people / partners

#Project inception

Workshop intended to produce:
- prioritised list of user needs
- prioritised list of story cards to feed into project teams

#Story cards
- Should contain "barely sufficient" information, just enough to begin development
- As an "X" I want "Y" so that "Z"
