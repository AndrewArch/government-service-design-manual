#URL design
URLs are part of the user interface of a service. They should be designed to be descriptive and bookmarkable, they shouldn't be used to preserve state unless it can be shared. Use HTTP properly. 

##Guidance
This will be a full explanation of the guidance or tool.

* Something about how to design URLs
* Something on how to use GET/POST/redirects

##Why we do this

> The "Smart Answers" on GOV.UK are designed for sharing. Having calculated your maternity or paternity entitlements you may well want to share the outcome with your partner or save it to come back later. The URLs contain all your previous answers and so sending that URL to anyone else will allow them to see exactly the same outcome you saw.
