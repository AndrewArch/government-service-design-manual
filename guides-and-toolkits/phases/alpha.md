##Alpha Phase

When designing a digital system it is impossible to predict everything up-front. Each project features many challenges, 

#What is the Alpha phase for?
- gain greater understanding of service by building prototype
- allow to trial design approach
- allow trial of technologies
- begin to form a team
- Gain shared understanding of the service at a coding and integrations level.
- Gain understanding of resources required to deliver beta.

#What should be in my alpha?
- just enough to gain understanding of service
- proof of concept, is it viable?
- enough to showcase to users / stakeholders

#How long does it take?
- No more than a few weeks (2 months)
- run maybe 6 one week iterations

#Who do I need?
- ServiceManager
- TechnicalArchitect
- SoftwareDevelopment

# Activities
 - ProjectInception
 - simple mock ups / prototypes / spikes 
 - iterations, 6 weeks with show & tell
 - showcase at end

#What are the outputs?

- high level story cards
- prioritised list of stories
- plan for alpha / beta / live (decreasingly detailed)
- working basic system that provides limited functionality that can be shown to a number of users
- spike or understanding around legacy systems to replace or wrap or integrate with
- cross-functional requirements
- decision to progress to next phase
