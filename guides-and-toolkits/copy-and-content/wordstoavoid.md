#Words to avoid
A collection of words and phrases to avoid in the creation of policies. To be used in conjunction with the [GOV.UK Style Guide](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/guides-and-toolkits/copy-and-content/styleguide.html).

##Guidance

Users will lose trust if we write government 'buzzwords' and jargon. Often, these words are too general and vague and can lead to misinterpretation or empty, meaningless text. We need to be concrete, use plain English and be very clear about what we are doing. 

##Words to avoid

Across government services we can generally do that very well without these words:

-   agenda (unless it is for a meeting)
-   advancing
-   collaborate (use 'working with')
-   combating
-   countering
-   deliver (pizzas, post and services are delivered – not abstract concepts like 'improvements' or 'priorities')
-   dialogue (we speak to people)
-   disincentivise
-   drive out (unless it is cattle)
-   empower
-   facilitate (instead, say something concrete about how you are helping)
-   focusing
-   foster (unless it is children)
-   impact (as a verb)
-   initiate
-   key (unless it unlocks something. A subject/thing isn't 'key' – it's probably 'important')
-   land (as a verb. Only use if you are talking about aircraft)
-   leverage (unless in the financial sense)
-   liaise
-   overarching
-   promote (unless you are talking about an ad campaign or something)
-   robust
-   slimming down (weight-loss is slimming down. Everything else is probably removing x amount of paperwork etc)
-   streamline
-   strengthening (unless it is strengthening bridges or other structures)
-   tackling (unless it is rugby, football, some other sport)
-   transforming (what are you actually doing to change it)
-   utilise

##Why we do this
With all of these words you can generally get rid of them by breaking
the term into what you are actually doing. Be open and concrete.
