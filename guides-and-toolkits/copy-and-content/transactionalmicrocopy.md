#Transactional microcopy
<p>Microcopy includes the questions and common text you may use throughout a service.  </p>

##Guidance
**Don’t use**:

<li>&lsquo;please&rsquo; on labels - give polite, clear, short instruction
<li>colons after labels 
<li>Don&rsquo;t add &lsquo;your&rsquo; to labels etc, for example: your name, your address etc, use &lsquo;name&rsquo;, &lsquo;address&rsquo;, unless you have a page with multiple people where you need to differentiate - for example: &lsquo;your name&rsquo;, ‘partner name&rsquo; etc
</li>

**Use**:
<li>sentence case 
<li>address the user directly 
<li>the cap convention in the style guide [link]
</li>

**Style:**
<li>first name &ndash; not Christian name
<li>last name &ndash; not family name
<li>middle name(s)
<li>age
<li>date of birth - in full, not DOB
</li>

###Help text

<p>There are 3 levels of text:</p>
<strong>On-page help</strong>
<p>One line under the label that will help the user to fill in that field.</p>
<p>Examples: &lsquo;If you don't have your form XYZ rsquo; or &lsquo;Where to find your Unique Tax Reference Number.&rsquo;

<strong>Show/hide</strong>
<p>Use an expandable show/hide box for slightly more lengthy instructions. You can use statements and questions but don't use the first person.</p>
<p> Examples: &lsquo;If you want to apply for both of these benefits&rsquo; (in this instance, you can&rsquo;t and there is another process you have to go through.

<strong>Light box</strong>
<p>Only use a light box for help if you are explaining a concept or part of a process - don't use it for explaining any part of the service. If you need to explain how the service works with that much text, your design is probably wrong.</p>


###Radio buttons

<p>Use: Yes [button] No [button] (note caps)</p>
<p>Keep to the same convention (yes first) on the page.</p>
