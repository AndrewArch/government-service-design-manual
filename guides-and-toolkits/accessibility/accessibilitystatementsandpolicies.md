#Accessibility statements and policies
Weâ€™re working hard to make our sites and services as accessible and usable as we can for everyone who needs to use them. The GOV.UK website does not include a separate accessibility statement, however.

The GDS team is not comfortable with a statement that draws a distinction between accessibility and any other aspect of best practice development.

##Guidance
Your service should be usable by recent versions of Jaws, NVDA, VoiceOver, Window Eyes and Supernova screen readers, ZoomText, Magic, Supernova and basic operating system screen magnifiers, as well as speech recognition software including Dragon Naturally Speaking, and native operating system speech packages.

##Why we do this
The services we provide are for the benefit of all citizens of the United Kingdom. As such, no user should be excluded on the basis of disability. To do so would breach the [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents).
