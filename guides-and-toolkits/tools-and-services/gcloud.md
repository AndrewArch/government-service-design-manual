#G-Cloud

G-Cloud is an online IT procurement catalogue for UK public sector bodies. It is accessed via [Cloud Store](http://gcloud.civilservice.gov.uk/)

There are four categories of products and services available: infrastructure, platform, software and cloud services.

G-Cloud is updated every 3-6 months and is a simple and transparent marketplace where prices update regularly. It provides services that are available to immediately procure and use.

##Why use G-Cloud?

G-Cloud is an approved pan-government framework, for use by all public sector organisations. This framework is compliant with EU regulations, thereby reducing the requirement to run separate competitions. 

The main benefit is reduced time to market, plus flexibility in contract term, i.e. some services are sold by the hour. The maximum term is currently 24 months. 

The G-Cloud framework is currently updated every six months, enabling new entrants with new products in to the market, increasing choice and competition.

##When not to use G-Cloud

You should not use G-Cloud where the service required is standardised, and is an off-the-shelf product requiring no customisation. 

Additionally, you should not use G-Cloud for procurements over the threshold (currently &pound;113K) where the spend value would require a compliant EU procurement, or procurements with an aggregate spend in excess of this amount. This does not prevent an organisation using G-Cloud to procure any services under the threshold.

Greater diligence is required when procuring ‘Cloud Services’ as these are more likely to less straightforward.

##What to do if you are unsure?

If anyone is uncertain about when to use G-Cloud talk to your Procurement department for advice, or [contact the G-Cloud team](http://gcloud.civilservice.gov.uk/contact-us/).
