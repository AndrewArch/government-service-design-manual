#Design skills
A good digital service needs needs talented, flexible designers and to help build user centred products.

##Guidance
Designers and front-end developers should work together in one team, designing in-browser. This is a better way of working and avoids silos. They should either already do this style of working or at least understand it.

When building a team ask to see examples of work and ask the designers to talk you through their contribution.

##Why we do this
Finding talented people is hard. But to build world class digital services we need to build a world class design team. This is the ideal opportunity to gain experience working on large digital products used by millions of people every day. Let's be clear about the impact of your work, making better digital services has a positive impact on millions of people.Avoid the terms “ux” and “creative”. Especially avoid “creative directors”. They will attract the wrong sort of people.
