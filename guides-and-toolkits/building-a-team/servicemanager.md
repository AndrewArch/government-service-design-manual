Outside government, organisations in the public and private sector are learning that empowered, experienced and highly skilled managers (often called Product Managers in the commercial world) are necessary to deliver high-quality digital services.

We are adopting that model, requiring each transactional digital service handling over 100,000 transactions each year to be developed, operated and continually improved by an experienced, skilled and empowered Service Manager. These are not technical IT posts, nor are they confined to running a website. Instead, they are individuals who work full-time to develop and deliver all the changes necessary to provide effective digital services. With a handful of exceptions, this is a new role within government. 

These Service Managers will:

- be experienced leaders, with an in-depth understanding of their service (built on continuity of involvement over a period of years) and equipped to represent their service and its usersâ€™ needs at all levels within the organisation. For high-profile services these will be at Senior Civil Servant level
- be accountable for the quality and usage of their service, and able to iterate the service based on user feedback at least every month
- be able to lead effectively on the change management and process re-engineering required to implement successful services
- have the digital literacy to engage with technical staff and suppliers to define the best system and platform configurations to achieve business/user objectives
- encourage the maximum possible take-up of their digital service by effective marketing, and specify/manage the requirements for assisted digital activity to supplement this
- oversee service redesign and subsequent operational delivery; supporting and ensuring the necessary project and approval processes are followed, monitoring and reporting on progress in line with the digital by default service standard, identifying and mitigating risks, and be empowered to deliver on all aspects
- actively participate in networking with other Service Managers inside and outside government, and share good practice and learning

Cabinet Office will help departments to recruit suitably skilled individuals. Newly appointed Service Managers will be supported by Cabinet Office through a specialist training programme run by the Government Digital Service. This will include the hands-on process of designing and prototyping a digital service.
