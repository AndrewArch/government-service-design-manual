#Sandbox and staging servers
* Everyone working on design, development or maintenance of a service should have a clear, easily accessible place to review the latest version of the software.
* Those working hands-on building the software for the service should be able to run their own reasonable replica of the entire service
* There should be a clear staging environment where changes are reviewed and tested in the context of the entire end-to-end service before they are deployed.

##Guidance/Tool
This will be a full explanation of the guidance or tool.

##Code/Templates
If you're giving people code r copy to cuta and paste then here is where it will go.

##Why we do this
* Everyone on the team should be able to understand progress to date by using running software
* People working on the product should be able to understand the impact of their work by seeing it working in context
* The team should be confident that the service as a whole works before shipping those changes to the public
