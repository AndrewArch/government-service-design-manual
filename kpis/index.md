The [digital by default standard](digital-by-default.html) sets four Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of your service: [cost per transaction](costpertransaction.html), [customer satisfaction](customersatisfaction.html), [transaction success](transactionsuccess.html) and [digital take-up](digital-takeup.html).

For each KPI you will work with GDS to set a sensible goal to reach within five years of the service going live. 

Once live, service performance will be monitored and displayed on the [performance platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance).
