#Accessibility testing
You should make accessibility testing part of your everyday activity. Testing accessibility in different ways and at different times is the best approach to ensure that no user is left behind.

##Guidance

###Agile testing
Accessibility should be one of your acceptance criteria. New features and incremental changes should aim to meet Level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) (WCAG) 2.0).

Agile testing can be done by members of your team, supported by your Accessibility Lead. It should be done in the spirit of agile development, with rapid iterations leading to success.

###Conformance testing
Accessibility conformance testing should be carried out at regular intervals. 
All or part of your service should be rigorously audited for conformance with WCAG 2.0 Level AA.

Accessibility audits can be done by your Accessibility Lead, or by a third party supplier. They should be done as a single large feature or collection of smaller features starts to take shape.

###Accessibility testing
Accessibility testing with older and disabled people should be done as often as possible. All or part of your service should be tested at least twice with people from the following groups:
* People with cognitive, reading and learning disabilities;
* People with mobility and physical disabilities;
* Deaf and hard of hearing people;
* Blind and partially sighted people;
* Older people and people with less experience using technology.

Accessibility testing is best done by a third party supplier. It should be carried out as a single large feature or collection of smaller features start to take shape.

###Maintenance testing
You should continue with all forms of testing once your service is live. Put 
together a programme of on-going testing that includes agile testing, 
conformance testing, and accessibility testing with older and disabled people.

##Why we do this
The services we provide are for the benefit of all citizens of the United Kingdom. As such, no user should be excluded on the basis of disability. To do so would breach the [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents).
