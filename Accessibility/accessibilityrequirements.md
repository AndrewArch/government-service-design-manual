#Accessibility requirements
We build services that are inclusive and easy for people to use. Your service should aim to meet Level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) (WCAG) 2.0 as a starting point.

Your service should be tested by disabled people, older people, and people who use assistive technologies. You should aim to do this at least twice as your service is developed.

##Guidance/Tool
This will be a full explanation of the guidance or tool.

##Why we do this
The services we provide are for the benefit of all citizens of the United Kingdom. As such, no user should be excluded on the basis of disability. To do so would breach the [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents).
