## What is Assisted Digital?
A brief definition of what is meant by assisted digital. 

### Guidance
[Action 9](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-09) of the Government Digital Strategy committed that, in the move to digital by default, 
we would put in place a cross-government approach to assisted digital support for the 18% of adults 
in the UK who are offline (never or very rarely use the internet) and for those who have limited digital capability.

Assisted digital support will meet the needs of citizens who face challenges of varying complexity 
in accessing public services digitally. The people who really need this support will still be able to 
access a service face to face, by phone, or in another appropriate non-digital way, with someone either 
inputting their data into the digital system on their behalf, or helping them put their data into the 
digital service themselves. This support will be designed around the specific needs of service users.

### Why we do this
Government recognises that citizens have different levels of digital capability and consequently 
will need different kinds of support depending on their ability and the type of digital transaction 
or service that is being accessed.  Good assisted digital support might also encourage and equip people 
to use the digital service independently in future. 

The aim is for public services to provide a high quality user experience digitally and become so 
straightforward and convenient that all those who can use them will do so, whilst those who can’t are 
not excluded. Assisted digital support is the way that more challenged users will access the services 
they are entitled to and can do the things that government requires of them.

## Understanding the size of the Assisted Digital audience
Service managers need to understand how many of their users are likely to be able to use digital services independently 
and how many are unlikely to be able to use digital services independently. These people will need assisted digital. 

### Guidance/Tool
User research and management information can be used to to understand assisted digital needs. 
Customer Insight practitioners or User Experience researchers use techniques such as customer segmentation 
(link here?) and profiling to divide their customer base into groups of individuals that are similar 
in specific relevant ways. This helps them to analyse factors in the use of a service eg. age, gender, 
disability, interests, motivations, needs or other demographics. These techniques allow them to target 
specific customer groups effectively, identify their related challenges, allocate resources, identify 
marketing strategies and meet their specific needs. 

Customer journey mapping (link here?) is another 
tool that enables organisations to map the touch points or life events which trigger 
engagement with government or public services and how this interaction could be managed more effectively 
for the user.

### Why we do this
User needs for assisted digital will also vary depending on who the users are. For example, services 
with large numbers of older people may need different assisted digital provision from services with 
large numbers of younger people. 

### Further reading
In November 2012 we commissioned independent research on the [digital landscape](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/)
to explore internet use in general and to gain insight on the relationship between users and government online transactions. 

## Assisted Digital delivery models
The Government has set out its strategy for how it intends to deliver services to people who are unable to
use digital channels. This section explains the Government's approach, and links to further detail. 

### Cross-government approach
The Cross-Government Approach to Assisted Digital complements [Action 8](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-08) 
of the Government Digital Strategy and strengthens the commitment to raising awareness and use of digital 
services over more traditional channels. 

The approach has a strong bias towards procuring external resource or support from the private and 
voluntary sectors and is open to other potential routes rather than in-house provision. In exceptional 
circumstances, departments may seek an exemption from this requirement; for example, where a business 
case for external support does not evidence a cost versus benefits value.  Any such exceptions would 
require agreement at cross-government level. 

There will be a strong preference for shared procurement models which evidence costs/benefits and 
support cross-government aims to meet efficiency savings in service delivery. To build trust and make 
location of assisted digital support easier for the user, service providers need to consider clustering 
and white-labelling as an option. The goal is to  identify the best methods for the user to access the 
type of support they need in a holistic way rather than grouping services based on departmental branding 
and transaction names. 

### The Standard
The proposition, design and development of an assisted digital service must meet essential criteria 
to quality assure the standard for assisted digital support. Central government will collaboratively 
develop a requirements framework with complementary performance and assessment criteria.   

The need for a quality mark and approved/accredited providers to promote consistency and enable adequate 
signposting to assisted digital support will be fully explored.

### Why we do this
A comprehensive programme plan is in development to include work with all stakeholders representing 
the requirements of assisted digital users. Appropriate governance via a programme board will be put 
in place to ensure consistency and collaboration across departments, organisations and services providers.

Before commencing any work to procure or develop a digital service or assisted digital support for 
accessing that service, the organisations responsible for devising the policy and delivery framework will 
need to consider carrying out an Equality Impact Assessment or Impact Assessment in line with their Public 
Sector Equality Duty, under the Equality Act 2010, and the [Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/2260/contents/made). This will support  good decision making and encourages public bodies to understand 
how different people will be affected by their activities, so that their policies and services are appropriate 
and accessible to all and meet different people’s needs.

21 major services are in planning to become Digital by Default by March 2015 - more details on these 
can be found in Departmental Digital Strategies#.  In addition, all services with over 100,000 transactions 
each year will be redesigned (Action 5 of the Government Digital Strategy). These services will only go 
live once they have met the digital service standard (Action 6 of the Government Digital Strategy), which 
will include a corresponding agreed standard of assisted digital provision.
