#Cookie Warnings
How and why we notify users about cookies on GOV.UK.

##Guidance
In line with European Law, we notify users whenever we use cookies on Government Services. 

This happens whenever users first visit GOV.UK, using the following banner:

>GOV.UK uses cookies to make the site simpler. [Find out more about cookies](https://www.gov.uk/support/cookies)

When a specific action sets a cookie, you will need to notify users. This will look like this: 

>[sets a cookie](https://www.gov.uk/support/cookies#)

That link will take users to the cookies page, and the appropriate description of the cookie being set.

##Why we do this
This cookies policy was devised following extensive research during the beta of GOV.UK. It followed the [The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1208/contents/made) (PECR). You can read more about how we decided this in [this blog post by GDS Developer Dafydd Vaughan](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/01/12/cookies-on-the-beta/).
