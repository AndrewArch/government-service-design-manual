#How to use the Manual

This short guide to the [Government Service Design Manual](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/) describes how you can use it for your projects, and what kind of feedback we’ll need to take into our Beta.

Remember, this site is an ‘alpha’ prototype. The guidance, reporting tool and criteria are incomplete, and shouldn’t yet be considered the canonical versions.

##Overview
[This short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIJgGTOCR3g) describes the Manual, and what each section does. Alternatively, read the short descriptions of each section below.

##The standard
The [Digital by Default standard](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/standard/) is a list of criteria that services and teams must meet before they go live. This list is very much under discussion, but it gives you a sense of what’s currently under consideration.

Creating a standard for services to meet was [one of the actions in the Government Digital Strategy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#initial-outline-of-proposed-digital-by-default-transactional-service-standard), and that includes things like basing development around users needs, iterating a service based on feedback, and making plans to meet key performance indicators.

##The reporting tool
The [projects page](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/projects/) shows you a list of what’s being worked on across government right now. It’s been populated with some of the exemplar projects the team at GDS are currently helping to scope or deliver.

When you click on a project, you can see more detail about what the team is working on. [The page being filled in by the Digital by Default team](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/projects/1/) is a good example of how to complete these.

The page shows you who is currently working on the tool, and you can read more about using this feature [below](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/handbook/194/#c6).

##The guidance
The [guides and toolkits](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/handbook/) are a pool of knowledge about how to build digital by default services. It contains code and copy for people to reuse, as well as advice about how to build features and the reasons for it.

When it’s released, teams across government will be able to contribute new approaches and tools. For now it’s been populated by GDS staff. 

Not every heading is full of content - around half of the guidance has been returned at time of writing - but if you want to see good examples of guidance then take a look at the pages about [Colour palettes](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/handbook/180/) or [Online research panels](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/handbook/157/).

##The community tab
Finally, [the community section](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/community/) will help users see what other teams are working on. 

This is the least well-defined section of the alpha, but it’s clear from early testing that users do want the means of asking questions of teams working on these problems throughout government. We need feedback about what will be most useful for your team(s) here.
