#Feedback and code review
All developers should be encouraged to review each others' code and to collaborate to make it better. That helps to prevent silos of knowledge and makes for more robust, durable code. Often another developer will find ways to break a piece of code with bad input or to optimise it, and that will help improve the design and the automated tests.

These conversations should take place in a forum that is open to everyone on the team and in a way that connects it back to the specific code under discussion.

> We use the Software-As-A-Service platform github for hosting our code and favour it for the conversation tools it provides. Developers do their work in code branches and create "pull requests" when they want their work to be merged in to the main product. Developers are able to comment on any specific commits (or even specific lines within the change) or on the pull request as a whole. That provides a clear record of who has reviewed the changes, but also regularly develops into useful discussions of how the code can be improved, whether it's taken the right approach, how it fits with similar work going on in other parts of the project, and so on.
