## Design principles

Anybody designing for GOV.UK, whether it's content, interfaces or whole services, should start by reading our 10 design principles. They're easy to remember, and if you keep them in mind whilst you're working they'll guide you towards the kind of results we need for GOV.UK.

[Read the GOV.UK design principles](http://gov.uk/designprinciples)



## Content design

The [GOV.UK style guide](http://gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide) tells you what writing conventions to adopt for GOV.UK. There's also more general advice on [how our users read](/service-manual/content-and-design/how-users-read.html) and how to [write for government services](/service-manual/content-and-design/writing-government-services.html). We also have guidance on [data visualisation](/service-manual/content-and-design/data-visualisation.html).

[See all guides for content designers](/service-manual/content-designers)


## Interface design

First read about our approach to [accessibility](/service-manual/content-and-design/accessibility.html). Then, if you're working on the visual side of things there are guides on [typograpy](/service-manual/content-and-design/design-and-development-resources/typography.html) and [colour palettes](/service-manual/content-and-design/design-and-development-resources/colour palettes.html).

If you're doing frontend coding you'll want to know about our [shared asset libraries](/service-manual/content-and-design/design-and-development-resources/shared-asset-libraries.html) and [Sass repositories](/service-manual/content-and-design/design-and-development-resources/sass-repositories.html). You'll also need to know which [browsers and devices](/service-manual/content-and-design/browsers-and-devices.html) to test with.

We also have guides on [designing transactions](/service-manual/content-and-design/design-and-development-resources/designing-transactions.html) and [forms](/service-manual/content-and-design/design-and-development-resources/forms.html).
