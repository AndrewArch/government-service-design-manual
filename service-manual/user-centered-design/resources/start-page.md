Every transaction on GOV.UK should have a start page.
Users should not be able to jump to a later page in the service via a search engine or some other means.

The design and hosting of start and end pages is typically managed by GDS. Raise a ticket in Zendesk and send us a summary of what your service does and what the user will get at the end of it, plus the 3 main pieces of information the user needs to get through the service, eg their National Insurance number, date of birth, bank account number.

Also include a list of the most important keywords for search engine optimisation because pages within the service won’t be indexed in GOV.UK search.
 
All start pages should meet the following goals:


## Describe the service

Include the name of the service, expressed as an action if possible ('Renew your passport', Claim for disability allowance', 'Book a driving test' etc.). If you need to, include a very brief description of the service.

Use the [GOV.UK SEO guidance](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/seo) for headings, introductions and metadata descriptions.


## Set expectations

People will base their expectations on their experiences of other digital services, like online shopping and banking.
If your service doesn't match these expectations then you should let your users know as early as possible.

In particular, people need to know up front about:

* financial costs
* long waiting periods or delays
* obscure information they'll need to provide
* complex eligibility requirements
* equipment they'll need (eg. a printer)
* non-digital parts of the transaction

Use common sense. Don't try to force everyone to read a page of terms and conditions before they start (they won't).

The best approach is to meet or exceed people's expectations. For example, if your delivery times are typical and you accept all the usual payment methods then you won't need to warn everyone about those things up front.


## Establish eligibility

If your eligibility requirements are relatively simple, write them on the start page.

If they're more complex you should consider offering an eligibility checker, eg a short 'smart answer'.
It's better to ask a few questions up front (and explain why you're doing this) than to let people invest time and effort in a transaction only to discover part way through that they're not eligible to use it.

Things that don’t work very well:

* long bullet lists of eligibility criteria on the start page
* links to ‘see guidance notes’ within a service that send users to long-winded documents
* when it’s not clear what’s the eligibility checker and what’s the actual application 
* eligibility checkers asking the same questions that will be asked in the service later on as users find this very frustrating
