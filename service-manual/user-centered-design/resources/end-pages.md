## Transaction end pages

The end point of any transaction should be a page on the GOV.UK domain.

These pages should let the user know:

* that they have successfully completed the transaction
* what further actions they need to perform, and when
* what further actions they can expect from the service, and when
* who they should contact with any queries or complaints
* about any related information and services


##Start and done pages

###Confirm or ‘submit’ page
You can have a confirm page in your service but you don’t have to. The purpose of this page is for the user to check anything they’ve done before they send it. 

Example:<br/>
Check your updated income details before making the change. 

Your income for this tax year: £25,000

[button] Make the change  

The button label should tell the user what it is they’re going to do, eg ‘Change your tax details’ or ‘Send your claim form’. Don’t just use ‘Submit’ or ‘Confirm’. 

If the action is too long, you can use a generic label, eg ‘Send’ or ‘Apply’ or ‘Make the change’. 

If terms and conditions are part of your service, users must actively say that they’ve understood what they’re signing up for. This can, for example, be an opt-in box or the user can type in a confirmation.  

###End or thank you page
Adapt the following format of the end page for your needs:

Thank you. 

You’ve [user action]. 

Example:
You’ve sent your Carer’s Allowance claim. 

What happens next?
[include things like when the user will hear back, contact number for questions]

[include links to other related services or things within the service user can do]

[button with link to GOV.UK done page] Finished 
or 
[link to GOV.UK done page] Sign out

Make sure the copy on this page matches what you asked the user to do at the beginning of the service, eg Remove a benefit, end page: You’ve removed Jobseeker’s Allowance. 


###Start and done pages
GDS will write and upload the start and done pages on GOV.UK. Raise a ticket in Zendesk and send a summary of what your service does and what the user will get at the end of it, plus the 3 main pieces of information the user needs to get through the service, eg their National Insurance number, date of birth, bank account number.

Also include a list the most important keywords for search engine optimisation because pages within the service won’t be indexed in GOV.UK search. 

Use the [GOV.UK SEO guidance](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/seo) for headings, introductions and metadata descriptions.
