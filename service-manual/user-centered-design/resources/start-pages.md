## Transaction start pages

The start point for any GOV.UK transaction should be a page on the GOV.UK domain. Users should not be able to jump to a later page in the service via some other means (eg Google).

The design of the start page will be determined by the nature of the service and its audience. All start pages should meet the following goals:

### Describe the service

The page should include the name of the service, expressed as an action if possible ('Renew your passport', Claim for disability allowance', 'Book a driving test' etc.). If you need to, include a very brief description of the service.

### Set expectations

People will tend to base their expectations of what a transaction involves on their experience of other digital transactions, for example, online shopping and banking.

If your service has features that do not match these expectations then you should inform your users of this as early on as possible, ideally on the start screen.

Users should be told about any financial costs or long waiting periods involved. If they'll be asked to provide relatively obscure information let them know so they can get it ready.

If there are specific eligibility requirements for the service let people know. If the eligibility requirements are complex you should consider using the Smart Answer format to help people understand whether or not they are eligible.

It's better to ask a few questions up front (and explain why you're doing this) than to let people invest time and effort in a transaction only to discover part way through that they're not eligible to use it.

GDS will write and upload the start and done pages on GOV.UK. Raise a ticket in Zendesk and send a summary of what your service does and what the user will get at the end of it, plus the 3 main pieces of information the user needs to get through the service, eg their National Insurance number, date of birth, bank account number.

Also include a list the most important keywords for search engine optimisation because pages within the service wonâ€™t be indexed in GOV.UK search. 

Use the [GOV.UK SEO guidance](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/seo) for headings, introductions and metadata descriptions.
