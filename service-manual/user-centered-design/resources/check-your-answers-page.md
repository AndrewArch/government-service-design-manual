For some transactions you'll want to provide your users with a way of checking the answers they've given before submitting them.

Here are some signs that you'll need one of these pages:

* the user has provided a lot of information
* the information is obscure
* the user has made important decisions
* it's very important that the information is correct
* the user has to declare that the information is correct
* it's hard to correct the information once it's submitted

Letting users check and edit their answers reduces error rates and gives reassurance.

The submit button on these pages must very clearly describe the action, eg ‘Change your tax details’ or ‘Send your claim form’. 
Don’t just use ‘Submit’ or ‘Confirm’. 

You can see [specific examples of this pattern](https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/Check-and-edit-your-answers-2DSpTH9J0wU) on the design patterns wiki.
