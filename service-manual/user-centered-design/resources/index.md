These are the building blocks that make up the pages and services on GOV.UK.
We've [started a wiki](https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/GOV.UK-design-patterns-0eUk1OdHvql) for people building services on GOV.UK to discuss the elements and patterns they're using.
As patterns on the wiki mature they'll be added to the list here.


## Design elements

The basic elements from which all pages are made.

* [Typography](typography.html)
* [Forms](form-labels.html)


## Design patterns

The elements can be combined into patterns which address a specific user need.
Here's a list of some of the more common ones.

### Forms

* [Names](names.html)
* [Dates](dates.html)
* [Addresses](addresses.html)
* [Nationality](nationality.html)
* [National insurance number](national-insurance-number.html)
* [Bank details](bank-details.html)


### Transactions

* [Start pages](start-pages.html)
* [End pages](end-pages.html)
* [Progress indicators](progress-indicators.html)
