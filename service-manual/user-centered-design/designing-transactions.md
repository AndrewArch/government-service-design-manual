A transaction is an exchange of money, information, rights or goods between two or more parties.
This guide is for anyone designing transactions for GOV.UK.

## Optimise for the majority

Find out what the majority of your users need and focus on this.
Test the simplest solution first and only add a new feature if you know people need it.
User research and customer data will help you decide which edge cases to support.

## Be honest about the proposition

Be honest up front about what users can and can't do with your service.
People need to know whether they're eligible, how much it will cost and how long it will take before they decide whether to commit to a transaction. The best place to tell them is on the first page.

## Be helpful

Most government transactions are used infrequently, so it's best to design as if people are using it for the first-time.

Some people will read up on a subject before they start, but many will choose to dive straight in. You need to support both types of behaviour.

## Choose an appropriate structure

Choose a structure for your transaction that fits the way most people are going to want to use it.
Don't structure it around the way your organisation works.

## Don't ask too many questions

Every extra question you ask places additional demands on your users.
They're more likely to make a mistake or fail to complete the transaction.

Don't ask for information just because it might be useful, or because you've always asked for it. 
Don't ask for the same information more than once. It makes your service feel inconsistent and disjointed.

## Follow the GOV.UK style guide

All written content on GOV.UK should follow the style guide. The style guide covers things like tone of voice, plain English, abbreviations and capitalisations.

[Read the GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles/style-guide)



### Use plain English

Use the language of your users rather than your organisation. Avoid jargon. For example, say 'Registration number' rather than 'Vehicle Registration Mark'.

If you have to introduce users to legal terminology make sure you explain it in plain English as well.


### Use the active voice

Tell users exactly what you want them to do. Don’t invent words to ‘sum up’ the action. 
For example, 'Tell HMRC about a change to your company car' not 'File an HMRC change request'.

This also applies to the name of your service, eg. 'Register to vote', not 'Electoral Registration Portal'.

 
### Be consistent

Use language consistently throughout your service.
For example, don’t switch from ‘last name’ to ‘family name’ half way through.
Make sure that words like 'you', 'we' and 'I' always refer to the same thing.


### Be clear

Make it clear who you're referring to at all times and don't use 'my' to label things as this is ambiguous.
For example:

* ‘Your address’ and ‘Your partner’s address’
* 'Tax' or 'Your tax', but not 'My tax'

On the start page say which organisation the user is dealing with, eg ‘Apply for funding from Defra’. 
After that you can refer to your organisation as ‘we’.

If it's still ambiguous, use the name of your organisation throughout, eg ‘HMRC will get back to you in 7 working days’.
