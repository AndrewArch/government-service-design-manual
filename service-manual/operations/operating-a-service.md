# Operating a service

Even perfect software requires occasional maintenance or a response to unexpected situations. Services will fail, hardware will need routine and emergency maintenance and the unexpected will happen. It is important that plans are in place to respond appropriately to these events and minimise disruption to your users.

In order to provide this response, the people and processes will need to be in place in advance. When designing a service, you will also need to design your operations model - how many people will you need, what time period will they need to cover, how will they be hired and how much will this cost?

# General principles

**People are a point of failure.** Designing an operating model around one person cannot be expected to provide 100% service. Service operation should revolve around at least two people, to provide cover for absence and to ensure continuity.

**The unexpected will happen.**
