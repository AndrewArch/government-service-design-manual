Capture these in a single free text box labelled: National Insurance number. 
Remember that ‘number’ isn’t capitalised and don’t call National Insurance number ‘NINO’.

National Insurance numbers are 9 characters long, but the characters are often spaced in pairs 
so you'll need to allow for at least 13 characters in any text fields.

Do not use "AB 12 34 56 C" as an example. 

Instead, use: "QQ 12 34 56 C"
