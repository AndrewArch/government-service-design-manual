Using the assisted digital action plan will help you to:
* understand your users’ assisted digital needs
* design support that meets their needs

##Discovery stage

###Action 1: understand your users

Get as much data on your users as possible and get an idea of how many of your users might need some form of assisted digital support. If there’s data you’d like but don’t have, put in a procedure to get it.
 
Also look at how you currently work with your user experts to deliver your service to users who need help making a transaction.

Concentrate gathering information on:

* the percentage of users that completes all/part of the current transaction digitally
* the initial percentage of users you’d like to have using your new digital service (ie how many of your users should/could/will never complete the transaction digitally)
* the demographic, socioeconomic and disability groups your users come from
* where your users live – are they concentrated in areas of the country with reduced access to the internet?
* what your users would do if they had no support to help them complete the transaction digitally - would they rather not complete the transaction at all?
* why some users prefer not to use digital channels – are they:
    * concerned about the security of the transaction?
    * worried about using computers in general?
* the kind of support users would like to have, such as:
    * demonstrations of the service
    * a dedicated phone line
    * other forms of support
* the support already available to users

###Action 2: develop assisted digital user profiles/stories

From action 1, you now know who your users are and how many of them may require some form of assisted digital support.
 
Now you need to build up a profile/story of the user groups least likely to complete a transaction online without some form of assistance - ie do you believe that users requiring assisted digital support have certain needs?

Develop a series of user stories that concentrate on assisted digital needs.

Eg “I’m a claimant and I want reassurance that my application for Carer's Allowance is made securely, so I can be confident that my personal information remains secure.”

Read [guidance on writing user stories](/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) for more information on how to do this.
 
###Action 3: develop your vision of an assisted digital user journey
 
Think about the end-to-end process. What do you think a user journey may look like?
 
Visualise the process by drawing it out, using a series of sticky notes to plot out the user journey. Concentrate on:

* each time a user interacts digitally in the transaction
* the support that can be used at each stage to help the user successfully carry out the transaction

Use each of the user profiles/personas you’ve developed. Make sure that as many of these user needs are met when developing your user journey.

##Alpha stage

###Action 4: Opening up the conversation with user experts
 
Run workshops with expert organisations working with your users and people who are offline whilst working with GDS to explore the range of options available in to delivering your assisted digital user journey. Ask these experts to challenge your assisted digital user journey and take on board their suggestions.
 
Work with GDS to see whether:

* any other government department has completed the process
* any lessons have been learnt that could help you
 
As part of the Open Policy Making process at GDS, a lot of this information will be published on GDS blogs. Consider doing something similar to engage the biggest range of experts who work with your users.

##Beta stage

###Action 5: review your options and test your process
 
Now it’s time to review what you’ve planned so far.
 
Use anything learnt from your last action to help finalise plans for assisted digital support and confirm your approach with those expert organisations already working with your users.

Develop a small-scale test of your proposed assisted digital option, working with:

* organisations who work with your users
* providers
* intermediates
* GDS
 
As part of beta testing, get users who’d actually need assisted digital support to test the support you’ve developed. Doing so means you can see whether or not your support meets their needs.

Ask the user if they were:

* able to complete the transaction without any assisted digital support.
* able to complete the transaction with the assisted digital support, and if so, ask:
    * what the user thought of the journey
    * what went well
    * if they think there’s something missing that would make the transaction easier to complete
* unable to complete the transaction with the assisted digital support, and if so, find out:
    * what stopped the user from completing the transaction
    * what could be done to improve their experience
    * if they’d now been put off from wanting to use a similar service in the future

###Action 6: review of assisted digital testing stage

Review the results of your small-scale beta test, involving:

* organisations who work with your users
* providers
* intermediates
* GDS
 
Act upon any lessons learnt from testing and implement any necessary changes.
 
The next stage is to develop a rollout plan on a larger scale for your assisted digital support - GDS is currently working with the Government Procurement Service to set up a framework for procuring the support for this.

##Live stage

###Action 7: review of assisted digital provision after go-live
 
After your digital service has gone live, continue to review your assisted digital support with your user experts, providers, and intermediates.
 
Continue to ask users for their feedback, so you know that your support is still meeting their needs. If not, adjust your support accordingly.
