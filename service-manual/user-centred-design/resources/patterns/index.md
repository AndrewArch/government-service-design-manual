{:.intro}
Use these design patterns to maintain a consistent design across our services.

Start with [the GOV.UK elements](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/elements) page, to find out how to make your service look consistent with GOV.UK. It also includes links to code snippets.

The patterns below describe our approach to services, transactions and forms.

## Detail patterns
* [Names](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/names)
* [Dates](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/dates)
* [Addresses](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/addresses)
* [National Insurance numbers](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/national-insurance-number)
* [Summary pages](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/summary-pages)
* [Confirmation pages](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/confirmation-pages)
* [Help text](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/help-text)
* [Progress indicators](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/progress-indicators)


## Process patterns
These patterns are about things that you need to do, for example: ask for a start page.
* [Form structure](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/form-structure)
* [Alpha and beta banners](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/alpha-beta)
* [Start pages](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/start-pages)
* [Done pages](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/done-pages)
