Common design patterns for GOV.UK services.

These patterns are based on the research and experience of the whole GOV.UK design community.
Use them to create a consistent and usable experience across GOV.UK services.

For a visual style guide, including front-end code snippets, see the <br>
[GOV.UK elements guide](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/elements).
