<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-1">1. Use the phrase 'Create a username'</h2>

Use a label like ‘Create a username’ rather than ‘Username’, so people understand that they're being asked to create a new username, not recall an existing one.

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-2">2. Explain what the username is for</h2>

The concept of usernames may not be familiar to people with low digital skills or low confidence online.
Help these people by explaining what the username is for and how it will be used.

This also helps people decide on a username. It's particularly important to tell people if their username will be visible to other people, or if it can't be changed.
