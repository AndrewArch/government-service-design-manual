*This page is being redesigned*

Architecture is not just about the design and deployment of technology -- to be successful you need to consider the utility, sustainability and attractiveness of the system as a whole. 
 
 We need to build an architecture where the consistency and overall clarity and consistence of form is sufficiently 
 persuasive and useful that a user can engage with government without understanding the minutia of policy or 
 departmental organisation. 
 
 We will talk a little more about the engineering details of architecture in due course.
