Agile methodologies help teams build world-class, user-focused services quickly and affordably. It can be a very different way of working for teams used to long-specifications and procurement processes, but it's essential for delivering high-quality services to a standard that many users expect. Agile is not just for digital teams. Many different businesses use agile project management techniques.

## What agile looks like

An agile project is focused on producing rapid iterations on products based on feedback from real users. Regular, rapid releases of small parts of code and constant communication between team-members makes for a fast-paced environment, facilitated by equipment that visualises the progress the team is making (whether that's in the form of project management software or whiteboards).

## User stories

Users are the heart of every digital by default service. This means having a clear understanding of what needs a feature being developed must meet. User stories are the prompts that help a team to produce these features, and writing them well can make a huge difference to the quality and speed of development.

## Features of agile

Agile product development is usually broken into small units of work called sprints. At GDS a sprint lasts a week and runs from Wednesday to Tuesday, however other agile development teams may run longer sprints.

Standups take place daily, and are an opportunity for teams to discuss the previous days work, tell people what they plan to work on, and reveal any blockers to progress.

## Retrospectives

Retrospectives are run at the end of each sprint to talk about what went well, what went badly and how to improve the working environment or process for the next sprint. Retrospectives can also increase in scope, to cover full projects or project phases.
