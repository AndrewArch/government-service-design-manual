#Who should take part

These 3 days contain specialist modules to help you succeed and improve in particular areas of the [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default).

Unless already very familiar with digital in government, participants should complete either the [specialist digital foundation day](/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/foundation-day) or the [service manager induction](/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/service-manager-induction) before taking part in the open programme.

All sessions will run at a central London location.

The programme is funded centrally, but you or your department will need to pay for any accommodation, meals and subsistence expenses, in line with your departmental policies.

#What's covered

The open programme includes the following modules:


##Increasing take-up

[Digital take-up](/service-manual/measurement/digital-takeup) is one of the four KPIs that services must benchmark, measure and monitor to meet the Digital by Default Service Standard. The group will:

* hear from GDS specialists in digital take-up

* consider barriers to adoption and how your services can overcome them

* assess the impact of channel shift on non-digital processes

##Assisted digital

Most users will be able to use new and redesigned government digital services unaided, but there are some who will need help. This support is referred to as [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital). The group will discover:

* who are the users who need assisted digital support

* what good assisted digital support will look like

* how departments and GDS are working together to develop assisted digital support approaches as part of overall service transformation

##Always be testing

Carry out user research in every stage of your project. Do it continuously through each stage -- don’t leave it as something that happens at the beginning and end of phases. You will find out how doing user research continuously will:

* keep your team concentrating on real user needs

* help teams design products which are prioritised by user needs 

* help teams iterate products in response to user feedback

##Design principles in action

A set of simple but powerful [design principles](/design-principles) underpin all the work done by GDS to develop the award-winning GOV.UK website. In this session your group will:

* discover the 10 design principles and how they were created

* hear from a product manager who has used them on a project

* consider how they will be applied to your own services

##Data-driven services

Using data to inform decision-making is vital to the development of your services. Your group will:

* discuss your service's performance indicators as they currently stand

* consider what data you currently use to inform your decision-making, and what data you would like to use

* design your own performance data dashboard to understand your services in a simple, visual way

* find out about the [Performance Platform](/service-manual/measurement/performance-platform) and how you can use it

##Identity assured

We need to know that users of digital services are who they say they are. In this session, you will learn how the GOV.UK Verify Programme is:

* creating a market so that users can choose from a number of identity providers

* setting standards for consistently meeting the needs of users, services and departments

* building and running the hub that connects services to identity providers

* working with departments and agencies to identify their services’ GOV.UK Verify requirements and plan their transition to using the GOV.UK Verify service

##Procure to improve

Delivering high quality digital services that improve continuously often depends on effective procurement. As a group you will:

* consider how to procure tools and systems fit for the purpose of agile, user-centred development

* discuss the range of options available, and how to determine make or buy decisions

* hear the latest on the government procurement processes and frameworks available on digital transformations

##Being agile

GDS delivery managers will lead discussions and exercises around key features of agile, such as:

* agile artefacts, themes, epics and user stories

* sprint planning and the use of walls to make shared priorities visible

* retrospectives to continually inspect and improve the work teams do together
