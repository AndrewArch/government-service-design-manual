GDS offers 3 highly practical learning and development programmes so you can strengthen the skills, knowledge and network you will need to succeed in your digital role.

#[Service manager induction programme](service-manager-induction.html)

Four days to equip newly appointed service managers with the basic knowledge, network and confidence to take the lead in transforming digital services.

This programme is designed specifically for newly appointed service managers who complete the programme in cohorts drawn from across government departments and agencies.

#[Specialist digital foundation day](foundation-day.html)

The foundation day (currently in alpha) is a one-day workshop covering the main points of the digital agenda for people directly involved in delivering digital services.

Participants may be in specialist digital roles, such as product manager, business analyst, designer or developer, or in non-specialist roles that are expected to work closely with digital teams.

#[Open programme](open-programme.html)

Three days of more specialist modules to help you succeed and improve in particular areas of the Digital by Default Service Standard.

Unless already very familiar with the digital agenda, participants should complete the foundation day or service manager induction before taking part in the open programme.

Newly appointed service managers should attend all three days of the open programme. Others may choose to join any or all of the days as appropriate to their role and development needs.
