Design of the service is everyone's responsibility. Those with the title of designer may have a particular focus on one or more specific design disciplines - interaction, graphic – but a good digital service needs needs talented, flexible designers to help build user-centred products.

## How designers work
Designers and front-end developers should work together in one team, designing in-browser. This is a better way of working, avoiding silos and ensuring that decisions are made with complete awareness of the implications.

As a result, the people you hire should already have worked like this, or at least understand it.

When building a team ask to see examples of work and ask the designers to talk you through their contribution. Avoid CVs that emphasise the terms “ux” and “creative”. Especially avoid “creative directors”. These people are probably not a good fit for your team.
