Design of the service is everyone's responsibility. Those with the title of designer may have a particular focus on one or more specific design disciplines - interaction, graphic â€“ but a good digital service needs needs talented, flexible designers to help build user-centred products.

## How designers work
Designers and front-end developers should work together in one team, designing in-browser. This is a better way of working, avoiding silos and ensuring that decisions are made with complete awareness of the implications.

As a result, the people you hire should already have worked like this, or at least understand it.

When building a team ask to see examples of work and ask the designers to talk you through their contribution. Avoid CVs that emphasise the terms 'UX' and 'creative'. Especially avoid 'creative directors'. We mean avoid 'UX' and 'creative' as nouns because we need them as adjectives.

Let's take 'creative' first. A CV that emphasised that term would probably be an advertising creative which is not what we're looking for. Of course we want designers (and developers and policy people) who are creative, but we think there are other ways of demonstrating that than putting the word in your CV a lot.

UX is harder, but similar. We strongly believe that UX is the responsibility of the entire team. From how fast the servers are, to how the copy is written, to what the structure of the url is. It's worth looking at Frances Berriman's [talk on this](http://fberriman.com/2012/06/14/designing-better-user-experiences-txjs-2012/). Too often, when UX is seen as a distinct discipline it leads to it getting brought in for a week or two at the end of a project and that is not what we want.

We can't build user-centred products with just UX experts. We need a whole organisation focused on user needs which is why our first design principle is [start with needs](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples#first).
