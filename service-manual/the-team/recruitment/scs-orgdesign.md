Getting the right people in the right roles is essential for building great digital services. Just as important however, is clear leadership and a well-defined split of responsibilities. It is essential for digital leadership to be on a par with ‘IT’ or ‘technology’ leadership, and to draw clear distinctions and interactions between the two roles. In departments that run transactional services, digital public services must be supported by the right back-end technology.  

Clearly, the best way for structuring senior technology roles will vary across departments. In larger departments providing multiple digital services, that may mean digital and IT directors reporting in to a board-level COO who has overall strategic responsibility for transforming the department through technology. In smaller departments, it may be more sensible to combine some roles. 

In all cases, the day-to-day management of contractual arrangements, retirement of existing legacy systems and provision of common services that are delivered centrally will be subordinate positions to the strategic transformational leadership of digital and IT. 

GDS will provide bespoke advice for departments on organisation structures and tailoring of SCS job descriptions. To support these discussions, we have set out a series of outline structures to fit a set of different organisational scenarios. These follow four fundamental principles:

* Technology must be strongly represented at Board level, by a CTO and a CDO, or a COO with responsibility for driving business change through technology
* Technology leadership must drive business transformation, not maintain a steady state
* Digital services and mission IT should - for now - be viewed as separate but strongly linked workstreams driving transformation across the department
* In departments running digital services, digital is represented at the same or higher seniority level as technology

These outlines are not intended to be a standard template we expect all departments will follow precisely. The suggested paybands are indicative, as is the relationship technology leaders have with the department’s management board. However, the diagrams should be taken as a firm indication of the relative positions and responsibilities that should be set out within a department’s organisational structure of those accountable for building digital services that meet user needs, and those accountable for delivering the internal technology that supports the delivery of those services. 

## Scenario 1

This diagram sets out a template structure for a medium to large department, that is responsible for managing a number of digital services and a significant existing IT estate. 

In this model Service Managers and Technology Project Leads have analogous roles - they deliver either the digital services or supporting back-end technology that meets users needs, and ensure that what they deliver is operated in such a way that continues to iteratively improve the offering. In bigger departments, it is likely there would be multiple people in these posts. The Head of Policy and Performance plays a coordinating role across the digital and technology estate, responsible for strategy and policy development, governance and capability building. The Head of Business IT ensures that the technology estate the organisation is running delivers significantly improved value for money, through the deployment of common services and the effective management (and retirement where appropriate) of legacy systems and contracts.

## Scenario 2

This diagram sets out a template structure for a smaller, policy-driven department, that is responsible for managing some digital services and a relatively small existing IT estate. The template may also be suited to a large agency or other NDPB that is responsible for managing large public-facing digital services and a supporting IT estate.

The choice of a CTO or CDO to lead technology transformation in smaller departments / agencies will depend on the number of services and the breadth of supporting technology systems they are responsible for. 

In organisations with multiple public facing digital services, a CDO is likely to be a more appropriate choice as new mission IT and the retirement of the existing technology estate must be done in such a way that fully supports the transformation of those digital services. However, in organisations where there are fewer public-facing services, a greater emphasis on driving more value for money from mission IT and providing more effective internal technology, a CTO may be more appropriate. In either case, a Director-level leader in this position will need to have a good combination of CDO and CTO skills.

## Scenario 3 

This diagram sets out a template structure for a department that does not manage any (or very few) public facing digital services, with technology provision focused primarily on providing tools for internal use.

The focus of the digital deputy director is therefore on policy, strategy and capability building in departments, as well as working closely with GDS to manage the organisation’s online presence on GOV.UK. The technology deputy director is likely to be primarily focused on delivering far greater value for money from the organisation’s technology estate, and liaising with the centre to make the best use of common technology services. GDS will support the CTO in coordinating across the digital and technology workstreams, ensuring effective portfolio and performance management through data collection and a clear oversight across all ongoing projects.
