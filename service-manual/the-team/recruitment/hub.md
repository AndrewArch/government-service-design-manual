GDS is supporting departments on digital and technology recruitment through a Recruitment Hub. This service is designed to help ensure the best possible candidates are in post to deliver excellent digital public services supported by the right technology. The hub will maintain the generic advice and job descriptions published in the service manual, support departments in tailoring them to meet their needs, and coordinate sifting, interviewing and headhunting support for senior and specialist roles. 

The Recruitment Hub is not intended to replace existing HR and recruitment processes, and exists purely to help organisations acquire these new and hard-to-reach skills. 

All queries for the hub should be made to [digitaltalent@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:digitaltalent@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). 

## SCS recruitment

GDS must approve the job descriptions and appointments for all SCS-level technology positions. The template [job descriptions], [organisation design advice] and [salary guidance] should be a useful starting point for departments and agencies to tailor to their specific roles. For SCS level hires, the Recruitment Hub will also provide:

* feedback, advice and approval on tailored organisational design and SCS job descriptions as needed, to ensure that the lines of reporting and share of responsibilities between other digital and technology (IT) leaders within organisations are clearly set out.
* coordinated headhunting support for departments looking to identify interim senior appointments
* GDS expertise to work with departments in sifting, shortlisting and interviewing of applicants
 
After a job description has been agreed and advertised, departments should contact GDS to confirm a date for sifting the applicants and producing a shortlist. Once a shortlist has been agreed, the department should confirm interview dates with GDS so an interviewer to join the panel. Following interviews taking place, the department must agree with GDS that the candidate selected at interview is suitable for the role before offering the appointment. Departments should continue to liaise with advertisers and Civil Service Commissioners directly. 

## Non-SCS specialist recruitment

GDS does not need to approve the appointment of non-SCS specialist posts, but will provide a similar level of support for departments seeking to bring in special digital skills. The template [job descriptions], [organisation design advice] and [salary guidance] should again be a useful starting point for departments and agencies, and is likely to require less tailoring than SCS roles. In addition, the Recruitment Hub will provide:

* feedback and advice on the design and organisation of digital delivery teams within departments 
* coordinated headhunting support for departments looking to identify specialist digital skills
* GDS expertise to work with departments in sifting, shortlisting and interviewing of some key Band A / Grade 6 / Grade 7 specialist posts 

In specific cases where a position requires a particularly specialist set of technical skills (eg technical architects, designers), departments should request sifting or shortlisting support from the Recruitment Hub. We cannot promise to provide this in all cases, but will endeavour to make expert advice available from the shortlisting stage for crucial specialist positions. This service should be requested when the post is advertised.

The Recruitment Hub will not:

* retain a set of SCS or non-SCS candidates that can be directly charged out from GDS to departments
* mandate GDS approval of all non-SCS positions, except where GDS has sat on an sifting / interview panel
* tailor job descriptions for positions below SCS level
* guarantee the availability of GDS experts for sifting / interviewing candidates in roles below SCS level, but will endeavour to provide it for key positions
* coordinate TiB faststream recruitment
