  <h2>Making a service</h2>

  <p>If you’ve already built a digital by default service, or want to get straight to guidance relevant to what you’re building, then you can explore by phase or role below.</p>

  <ul class="phases">
    <li class="discovery">
      <h2><a href="/service-manual/phases/discovery.html">Discovery</a></h2>

      <p>A short phase, in which you start researching the needs of your service’s users, find out what you should be measuring, and explore technological or policy-related constraints.</p>

      <p><a href="/service-manual/phases/discovery.html">Learn about the discovery phase</a></p>
      
      <img src="/service-manual/assets/images/phases-icon-discovery.png" alt="Discovery phase">
    </li>
    <li class="alpha">
      <h2><a href="/service-manual/phases/alpha.html">Alpha</a></h2>

      <p>A short phase in which you prototype solutions for your users needs. You’ll be testing with a small group of users or stakeholders, and getting early feedback about the design of the service.</p>

    </li>
    <li class="beta">
      <h2><a href="/service-manual/phases/beta.html">Beta</a></h2>

      <p>You’re developing against the demands of a live environment, understanding how to build and scale while meeting user needs. You’ll also be releasing a version to test in public.</p>

    </li>
    <li class="live">
      <h2><a href="/service-manual/phases/live.html">Live</a></h2>

      <p>The work doesn’t stop once your service is live. You’ll be iteratively improving your service, reacting to new needs and demands, and meeting targets set during its development.</p>
