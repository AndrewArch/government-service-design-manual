## Getting a domain name and start/end page

To make sure that the right user journey (appropriate start/end pages, clear domain names) are set up
for a new service it's important that you engage with the GOV.UK team within GDS early.

If you're not already in conversation with the team about your service tou can start the process by e-mailing
gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.
