## Introduction

The [Government Digital Strategy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/) committed the government to ensuring all new or redesigned transactional services meet a digital by default service standard from April 2014. Services must meet this standard before they are launched on [GOV.UK](http://gov.uk). A draft version of this standard is set out below. It will be agreed and set in April 2013.


## The digital by default standard

A team must demonstrate that they have done the following to achieve the digital by default standard:

1. analysed the prototype service’s success and ensured that user feedback is translated into features for the next phase of development
2. built a working prototype, using the agile, iterative and user-centred methods set out in the Government Service Design Manual (GSDM)
3. kept a regularly updated public blog explaining how they have designed their service and sharing new ideas and knowledge with others in the same position
4. put in place a multidisciplinary team, led by a single, suitably skilled and empowered Service Manager, to design, build, operate and run the service
5. a plan in place for ongoing user testing, including the ability to support multivariate experiments
6. created a service that is simple and intuitive enough that all users succeed first time, unaided
7. conducted research to develop a deep knowledge of who the service users are, what the user needs are, and what that implies for their digital and assisted digital service design 
8. successfully tested the service from beginning to end with the responsible Minister
9. a plan (developed with GDS) for the phasing out of existing alternative channels in place
10. a contingency ‘rollback’ plan in place should the service have to be taken offline
11. built and resourced a service that can be improved daily, ensuring that user feedback and performance data is translated into development
12. an ongoing ability to test the end-to-end service as if it were in an environment identical to that of the live version, with dummy accounts and a representative sample of potential service users, on all common browsers and devices
13. considered the user data and information the service will be providing or storing, and addressed the security level, legal responsibilities and risks associated with the service
14. used open standards and common Government platforms (e.g. Identity Assurance) where available 
15. considered the tools and systems they will be using to build, host, operate and measure their service, and how to procure them
16. made all new code open, reuseable and published under appropriate licenses 
17. got the capacity and technical flexibility to update and improve the service on a daily basis
18. established performance benchmarks to define success in consultation with GDS, using the 4 key indicators (KPIs) defined in the GSDM against which the service will be measured 
19. instrumented analytics tools and ensured that performance data is collectable
20. a plan for, and evidence to support, achieving a low cost per transaction across the digital and assisted digital service that is reported on the PP
21. achieved, and will continue to achieve, high levels of user satisfaction across the digital and assisted digital service that are reported on the Performance Platform (PP)
22. a plan for, and evidence to support, achieving a high digital take-up (and targeted assisted digital support at people who really need it) that is reported on the PP
23. achieved, and will continue to achieve, high transaction success rates across the digital and assisted digital service that are reported on the PP
24. used the Government Service Design Manual to develop the content and design to ensure the service has the same look, feel and tone as GOV.UK
25. considered the seamless integration of the service’s digital and any non-digital steps that are required for legal reasons
26. put assisted digital support in place 

## How to meet the standard
