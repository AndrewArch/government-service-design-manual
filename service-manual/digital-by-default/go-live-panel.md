## Go Live panel

A Go Live panel will make the final decision on whether a service should be awarded the standard and be launched. The panel will convene within 2-3 weeks of a request being made by the responsible service manager. It will be chaired by GDS, and include a Digital Leader and a service manager (not from the presenting department) on the panel. It will also include other independent experts if suitable and available. Other Digital Leaders and service managers will be free to attend as observers.

The panel will ask questions about the service itself and the evidence set out in the teamâ€™s public record. At the conclusion of the meeting, the panel will:

- **Approve:** The service should be awarded the standard, and is ready to be launched on GOV.UK.
- **Resubmit:** The service is nearly ready, but there are some outstanding evidence gaps. The panel will agree a date to reconvene (ideally within 3 weeks) to consider new evidence or updates.
- **Reject:** The service is unable to demonstrate evidence for criteria seen as essential by the panel.
