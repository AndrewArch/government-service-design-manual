      <p>Building a great digital service is a complex task, with many risks. To maximise the chances of success it is best to break the work down into discrete phases.</p>

      <p>Each phase can be thought of as an iteration of the idea, increasing the level of detail, complexity and risk throughout.</p>

      <p>This iterative approach allows the team working on the service to start small, learn fast, and deliver value to our users as early as possible.</p>
