The objective of this short phase is to gain an understanding of what the users of the service need, what the business requirements are and what technological or policy related constraints there might be.

This is achieved through research, workshops and interviews. Typical outputs from this phase are a list of user needs, high level wireframes or prototypes and possibly user personas.

A small team will be required and the phase should not take longer than a week. At the end of the phase a decision should be made whether to proceed to the Alpha phase.

##Discovery phase

# What is phase for?

Discover at a very high level what the service is for, which user needs it is intended to serve, and what we may need to deliver it

Use various techniques to gain understanding
- workshops
- simple mock ups / prototypes 
- whiteboard diagrams

Provide high level business context
-	service overview
-	key drivers & goals
-	constraints
-		technical, regulatory, legacy, cost etc
		
High level understanding of the service
-	high level user needs
-	sketch flows through service
-	sketch domain model
-	legacy interfaces
-	legacy to decommission
-	key metrics
 - number of users
 - number of transactions
	
people / partners
-	who owns service?
-	departments / suppliers
-	identify service manager, product manager

##How long does it take?
workshops, 3 days or so

## Who do I need?
- # ServiceManager
- # TechnicalArchitect
- # representatives of business team
- # delivery manager

##What are the outputs?
- high level user needs
- understanding of landscape
- understanding of team / capability
- ability to scope & plan an AlphaPhase
- Decision to progress to next phase
- maybe some rough prototypes

##What next?
Next Phase: [Alpha Phase](/service-manual/phases/alpha.html)


#Project inception

Workshop intended to produce:
- prioritised list of user needs
- prioritised list of story cards to feed into project teams

#Story cards
- Should contain "barely sufficient" information, just enough to begin development
- As an "X" I want "Y" so that "Z"
