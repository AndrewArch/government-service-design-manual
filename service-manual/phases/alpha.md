The objective of this phase is to build a working prototype that can be used by stakeholders or a closed group of end users. This will enable you to trial technology and get early feedback on the design of the service.

The team will work iteratively, with an inception followed by development, a showcase and a retrospective.

You may need to bring more developers and designers into the team, but the whole phase should not last longer than about six to eight weeks. By the end of the phase you should have a clear idea of what's required to build a Beta.

##Alpha Phase 

When designing a digital system it is impossible to predict everything up-front. Each project features many challenges, 

#What is the Alpha phase for?
- gain greater understanding of service by building prototype
- allow to trial design approach
- allow trial of technologies
- begin to form a team
- Gain shared understanding of the service at a coding and integrations level.
- Gain understanding of resources required to deliver beta.

#What should be in my alpha?
- just enough to gain understanding of service
- proof of concept, is it viable?
- enough to showcase to users / stakeholders

#How long does it take?
- No more than a few weeks (2 months)
- run maybe 6 one week iterations

#Who do I need?
- ServiceManager
- TechnicalArchitect
- SoftwareDevelopment

# Activities
 - ProjectInception
 - simple mock ups / prototypes / spikes 
 - iterations, 6 weeks with show & tell
 - showcase at end

#What are the outputs?

- high level story cards
- prioritised list of stories
- plan for alpha / beta / live (decreasingly detailed)
- working basic system that provides limited functionality that can be shown to a number of users
- spike or understanding around legacy systems to replace or wrap or integrate with
- cross-functional requirements
- decision to progress to next phase
