The objective of this phase is to provide a fully resilient service to all end users. The service should now meet all security and performance standards.

This is not the end of the process though. The service should now be improved continuously, based on user feedback, analytics and further research.

The team may need to be reconfigured to reflect the operational requirements of the service.

Describe your new page IterationImprovementAndOperationPhase here...

* Operational support - technical and customer-support
** Includes pro-active monitoring for how the service could be better
(see analytics below)
** Includes monitoring of system performance to optimise the code
** Includes pro-active monitoring of security alerts, etc to make sure
software gets patched
* Using analytics and constantly iterating
* Repeating the whole process for smaller pieces - find something that
needs improvement, do some discovery, iterate, release. that should be
a constant rhythm and done rapidly.
