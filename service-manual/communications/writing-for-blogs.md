Good blogposts follow the same basic rules of good writing. A good post should be:

Brief

Remember “tl;dr” (too long; didn’t read). There’s no exact limit; what works best will depend on the specific subject matter and who it’s written for, but as a general guideline if it takes longer than half an hour to write, or longer than 5 minutes to read, it’s probably too long for one post.

Audience-focused

Write with your intended audience in mind (but be aware that others will read it, so avoid jargon or too much detail). There’s some flexibility in terms of length, style and tone to cater for specific audiences.

Transparent

Blog posts can be created and changed quickly and easily, by the author or by other users with the necessary administrator permissions. This makes it even more important to be transparent about doing this. Any content that’s updated or removed should always be marked as such within the post.

Timely

Blogging is all about moving quickly, to create posts - several of which can go up each day - and to respond to comments. The window of interest in a particular topic, or to mark a milestone, can be very brief. Once the moment is past, the post might not be appropriate for blogging.

Responsible

Personal in style, rapid in production, light-touch in styling...all reasons why the basics still need to be remembered when blogging. In particular, the Civil Service code, the GOV.UK style guide, and social media guidance for civil servants.

Accurate

A blog post may look less formal than other types of government communication but it still needs fact-checking. Authors are responsible for backing up any quotes or claims - and each blog will have a process around posting that will support this.

Personal

People, not organisations, write blog posts. Authors should tell the story in their own voice. Posts will still need to be in line with the style guide, up to standard, and accessible to the audience, but they won’t be clinically rewritten so they all sound the same. 

To the right standard

Each post should include:

a named author: set up as a user of the blog (so that comment notifications will arrive automatically) - except for guest bloggers where a generic author account can be used

a clear lead-in: brief introductory paragraph which allows the reader to quickly grasp what the post is about. If used with a “More” tag, the introductory paragraph can be displayed on the blog’s home page.

relevant tags: including the author’s name, and where applicable, the department or agency to which the post relates, the featured topic, or any other classification which may be useful for a user looking for information and wishing to see related content pulled together

relevant links: other organisations, research quoted, published documents, other sites that will add value to the user’s experience of reading the post

images: at least one image (screengrab or photo) or embedded video within the text; and 

signposts: including explanatory sub headings, image attributions (and links to image sources), or references to subsequent edits, corrections or retractions.



## How to write a blog post

The manual has plenty of useful resources explaining how to write effectively for an online audience. The guides on [how government should write](/service-manual/design-and-content/writing-government-services.html) and [how users read](/service-manual/design-and-content/how-users-read.html) are a good place to start. To get sense of the style and tone, look at the [GDS](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk) or [Ministry of Justice](http://blogs.justice.gov.uk/digital/) blogs.

### Writing for the right audience

Service team blogs will be read by lots of different people.

First, they will be read by the service’s users, the public. Amongst other things, that means resisting the use of acronyms and jargon as much as possible. Following this rule will also help senior internal stakeholders to use the blog for a quick overview of the team’s progress.

They will also be read by the [Go Live panel](/service-manual/digital-by-default/awarding-the-standard.html#go-live-panel) to help determine whether a service is ready to be launched. Clarity on what has been done and why, and pointing to evidence for taking decisions on service design will be what they look for in their assessments. Woolly words and unsubstantiated assertions will not help.

Other teams in government will read the blogs to find out how people going through similar challenges overcame them. Blog posts should therefore be written with some consideration of any broader application an approach, tool or technique may have. That applies as much to things that didn’t work as things that did.


Blogging processes

Getting a blog

Any business case made for continuous series of posts that are relevant to the work of a team or organisation is likely to be accepted. Continuity is important: a few interesting articles do not make a blog by themselves (though they may be posts on a blog). Creating a new blog is a commitment to sustaining it over time, and needs resources allocated to a flow of new posts, comments and reader engagement.

Examples are the GDS blog, existing departmental and agency blogs moving to GOV.UK as part of departmental transition, and service teams that are blogging their progress towards meeting the Digital by Default Service Standard. For the latter, the blog will be an essential source of evidence for when services are reviewed on whether they have met the standard ahead of being launched on GOV.UK.

Authorship

The author will always be a named, registered user of the GOV.UK blogging platform (with an exception for one-off ‘guest’ bloggers, where a generic team author account can be used). Authors will write the post (for an intended audience), add links, source images, add any attributions required and oversee comment discussions (supported by the comment guidelines below). As standard, they will create the post and add links and images within the blogging platform.

Coordination

Coordination is not just the checking that blog posts contain timely, relevant, tailored content and that the principles above are applied consistently, but also the planning and timing of blogging within wider narratives. Departments will be responsible for the coordination of their own blogs. 

Moderation & usage

As with coordination, moderation will need to be taken on by departments for their own blogs. 

Below are examples of the approaches that are used by the Government Digital Service for its own blog and should provide useful guidance on the issues to consider when developing guidance for departmental or other blogs:

GDS is part of the Cabinet Office, and use of this site is governed by the Cabinet Office website’s terms & conditions and privacy policy.
Guidelines for commenters:
be respectful of others who use this site
stay on topic
do not use language that is offensive, inflammatory or provocative (this includes, but is not limited to, swearing and obscene or vulgar comments)
do not break the law (this includes libel, condoning illegal activity and contempt of court)
do not use this site for party political purposes (this site is paid for with public money so it’s inappropriate to engage in party political activity)
please do not post personal information in comments such as addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or other online contact details, which may relate to you or other individuals
do not impersonate or falsely claim to represent a person or an organisation
do not make any commercial endorsement or promotion of any product, service or publication not relevant to the discussion
If you are aged 16 or under, please get the permission of your parent or guardian before participating. Users without this consent are not allowed to participate.
Moderation policy
Blog comments are pre-moderated to check they comply with the GDS guidelines for commenters above. If comments don’t comply they will not be published.

This is how we evaluate comments:
Is the comment on topic, does it add value to the discussion and can GDS answer publicly?
If so, approve it, and post a timely response within 24 hours.
Is this person asking for information or detail relating to another GDS channel, e.g. is it a GOV.UK content query or an issue with a tool, transaction, bug or performance problem?
If so, we’ll pass the query on and ensure it is dealt with as quickly as possible, and tell the user that this has been done. We will update the user on progress. If it adds value to the comment thread then this exchange can be added as open comments.
Is this comment a rant at GDS venting frustration or anger?
If so, monitor and discuss with the GDS communications team first.
Pingbacks - references to links made to our blog - are also pre-moderated. Where the context of the link adds value to the discussion, the pingback will be posted to the comments thread. Collections of “interesting links” don’t generally pass this test of adding value.
