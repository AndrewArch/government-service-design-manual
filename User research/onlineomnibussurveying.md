#Online Omnibus surveying

Your section will begin with a short, two-line summary of what you're showing people.

##Guidance/Tool

Online Omnibus surveys are an effective way of interviewing a representative number of people, in a short period of time, and for a relatively low cost. Omnibus surveys of this type use online panels to gather their sample, and as with regular, offline cost are kept down by collating questions on a variety of subjects, from a number of clients, and these questions asked during the same interview, as well as the demographic information on each respondent. 

##Where/how you might use it

Omnibus panels are ideal when you have key questions that you want answering, and need to reach a representative number of people quickly and cheaply.

##Weaknesses/when not to use

A omnibus survey is not appropriate when there are too many questions required. This would result in the survey being too long (combined with questions from other clients).

##No./Types of participants

Online panels are ideal for obtaining a representative sample of respondents (2000+), across all demographics, including hard to reach groups.

##Cost

Omnibus surveys are costed by the type of questions clients want to ask. Pre-coded questions are the cheapest (approximately £300 per question), and open ended or questions with video clips the most expensive (approximately £600 per question).

A set of ten questions on an Online Omnibus would cost approximately £5,000, depending on question type.

##Timescales

Online Omnibus panel can be conducted relatively quickly, with most companies running surveys twice a week with data delivered 4 days after survey goes in to field. Some companies offer an ‘on demand’ service where surveys can start any time, although a minimum of questions is normally required.
