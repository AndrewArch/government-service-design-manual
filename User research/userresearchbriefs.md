#User research briefs
Research briefs are a key mechanism that enables internal researchers to procure user research via third party agencies. A research brief will outline the research objectives, and why the work is required. Agencies can then respond to the brief and recommend suitable ways to conduct the work, and address the research objectives. 

##Guidance/Tool

A Research brief should contain the following information:

* **Background** – this should include a background of the organisation that is conducting the research, what relevant research has been conducted previously (or is being conducted), and the overall need for the piece of research that’s being procured. 

* **Business objectives** - this should include an explanation of the business objectives that the research is addressing. This is essential as it explains how the research will be used by the business.

* **Research objectives** - the research objectives should outline what the research is trying to achieve e.g. 

* **Target Audience/Participants** - this should identify who you want to talk to, and focus on the target audience for the product/service you are building. It is also common to put key demographic information in this section, and if there are any areas of the country you want the research to be conducted in.

* **Preferred Approach/Methodology** - it is recommended that research agency consider the objective of the research and recommend the most suitable methodology, however, it is common practice for in-house research teams to provide an idea of how they think the research could be conducted.

* **Cost** - this section should out the budget available for the research. It is suggested that research agencies should be asked to provide a range of price options, so that insight teams can choose the most appropriate approach for their needs.

* **Deliverables** - this should outline how you want the research delivered e.g. presentation, workshop etc.

* **Timings** - this should specify when the research is to be delivered.

* **Project team** this section should specify who is on the project team and their contact details.
