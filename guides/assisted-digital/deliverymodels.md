#Assisted Digital delivery models
The Government has set out its strategy for how it intends to deliver services to people who are unable to
use digital channels. This section explains the Government's approach, and links to further detail. 

##Cross-government approach
The Cross-Government Approach to Assisted Digital complements [Action 8](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-08) 
of the Government Digital Strategy and strengthens the commitment to raising awareness and use of digital 
services over more traditional channels. 

The approach has a strong bias towards procuring external resource or support from the private and 
voluntary sectors and is open to other potential routes rather than in-house provision. In exceptional 
circumstances, departments may seek an exemption from this requirement; for example, where a business 
case for external support does not evidence a cost versus benefits value.  Any such exceptions would 
require agreement at cross-government level. 

There will be a strong preference for shared procurement models which evidence costs/benefits and 
support cross-government aims to meet efficiency savings in service delivery. To build trust and make 
location of assisted digital support easier for the user, service providers need to consider clustering 
and white-labelling as an option. The goal is to  identify the best methods for the user to access the 
type of support they need in a holistic way rather than grouping services based on departmental branding 
and transaction names. 

##The Standard
The proposition, design and development of an assisted digital service must meet essential criteria 
to quality assure the standard for assisted digital support. Central government will collaboratively 
develop a requirements framework with complementary performance and assessment criteria.   

The need for a quality mark and approved/accredited providers to promote consistency and enable adequate 
signposting to assisted digital support will be fully explored.

##Why we do this
A comprehensive programme plan is in development to include work with all stakeholders representing 
the requirements of assisted digital users. Appropriate governance via a programme board will be put 
in place to ensure consistency and collaboration across departments, organisations and services providers.

Before commencing any work to procure or develop a digital service or assisted digital support for 
accessing that service, the organisations responsible for devising the policy and delivery framework will 
need to consider carrying out an Equality Impact Assessment or Impact Assessment in line with their Public 
Sector Equality Duty, under the Equality Act 2010, and the [Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) Regulations 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/2260/contents/made). This will support  good decision making and encourages public bodies to understand 
how different people will be affected by their activities, so that their policies and services are appropriate 
and accessible to all and meet different peopleâ€™s needs.

21 major services are in planning to become Digital by Default by March 2015 - more details on these 
can be found in Departmental Digital Strategies#.  In addition, all services with over 100,000 transactions 
each year will be redesigned (Action 5 of the Government Digital Strategy). These services will only go 
live once they have met the digital service standard (Action 6 of the Government Digital Strategy), which 
will include a corresponding agreed standard of assisted digital provision.
