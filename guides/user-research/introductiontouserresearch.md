This guidance is aimed to provide a broad overview of the types of methods and techniques that are available to conduct user research. More detailed guidance on each of these techniques is available in the manual. 

##Guidance

User research can be categorised into two broad themes – product research, and strategic research. 

Product research can incorporate both qualitative, and quantitative techniques. Qualitative techniques include focus groups, 1:1 interviews, ethnography etc., and are typically used to explore and analyse unstructured data. Quantitative techniques can include online surveys, face-to-face interviews, and involve a structured approach to data collection and analysis. 

Product based research can be conducted in-house or via a specialist agency. In-house approaches can be quicker as they involves less lead time (e.g. procurement), but require skilled in-house researchers, and can involve the procurement of some specialist software. Typically agencies are only used when a specialist skills/experience is required that is not available in-house, and/or the scale of the project would mean it’s difficult to provide dedicated internal resource. 

Strategic research also uses quantitative and qualitative methods and is used to help understand the appetite for a product or service – typically looking at the size of the market, trends, type of users etc. 

Secondary data, also known as desk research, can be used, and involves the analysis of existing research or information sources.  Ideally, secondary research should be conducted before embarking on any research project to understand what is already known, and what research is required to fill the knowledge gaps.  This can range from published research, news article, or internal research that has been conducted previously.

##How to use

The diagram below illustrates the typical product lifecycle, showing the stages at which user research should be conducted. This chart can be used as a reference to ensure that user needs are being factored into design at every stage. Typically this will involve some initial fact finding in the early stages to see understand the user needs, including who they are, how they currently do things, how they’d like to do them, and what information is currently available. 

If there is already an existing product, it is sensible to collect benchmarking information (satisfaction, task completion etc) so that the performance of the new product can be measured. Following this, prototypes/wireframes should be reviewed by usability experts, and tested with users, and benchmarks gathered.
Finally there should be continuous testing and benchmarking to ensure the service continues to perform as expect, and meets the need of the target audience.
