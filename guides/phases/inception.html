#Project inception

Workshop intended to produce:
- prioritised list of user needs
- prioritised list of story cards to feed into project teams

#Story cards
- Should contain "barely sufficient" information, just enough to begin development
- As an "X" I want "Y" so that "Z"

#Who do I need?

#How long does it take?
