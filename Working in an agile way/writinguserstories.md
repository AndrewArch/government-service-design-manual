# Writing user stories

User stories are an essential part of the agile toolkit, a way of organising work into managable chunks, which may be then discussed and prioritised independently of each other.

A user story is represented by a story card with a few lines of text such as:

As a **journalist** (actor)<br/>
I want to **see contact information for media enquiries relating to the news article I am reading** (narrative)<br/>
So that **I can get directly in touch with the press office about it** (goal)

Some key points to note:

* story cards follow a standard **structure** – title, actor, narrative and goal
* story cards **do not capture every detail** they are a promise of further discussion at the appropriate time
* user stories **only work in the context of an agile team** with embedded customer/user representatives

A user story is a simple, collaborative tool which emphasises face-to-face communication and a focus on user needs. 

## Working outside-in using goals

Building useful software systems is hard. How can we make sure we're solving the right problem? Developers love solving problems and playing around with technology, so it can be tempting to dive in to solutions before really understanding the problem. 

Agile methodologies emphasise an outside-in approach .. what outcome is your service user trying to achieve? If we dive into the solution without a good  understanding our users, we risk solving the wrong problem, or coming up with solutions which don't really work for our users in the real world. That's why the most important part of a user story is the **GOAL**. 

As a service owner writing stories with your development team, always start by thinking about and discussing your users' goals. Why do they want to use your service? What are they trying to achive? What need has motivated them to seek out your service? In what context do they use it? At home? At work? On a mobile phone? Whilst caring for a child? How often? Suzanne and James Robertson have excellent advice on this[1]. 

Being specific about the **ACTOR** can help you to break down interactions into logical chunks. Sometimes the actor will be a customer of your service. Sometimes the actor will be an administrator, technician or manager within your organisation. Hopefully you already have a good understanding of your customers from preliminary project work or existing research. If not, make sure you take the time to develop that understanding.

Finally the narrative should serve as a reminder of the main flow of interaction which needs to be addressed. However the story card does not need to spell out every detail…

## Taking a rain check &mdash; the promise of a conversation

Agile teams prefer face-to-face conversation over detailed documentation[3]. Face-to-face is faster and more accurate than written documentation and allows developers to build up a detailed mental model of the user goals, workflows, constraints and all of the myriad issues which must be taken into account when building a software system. 

The story card is just a placeholder, a promise to have a conversation when the time is right. We can use the story card and some brief initial conversations to estimate a story and fit it into an agile backlog. When development work actually starts the users or customer proxy can be consulted to fill out the details. The user story is the sum of all of these conversations, sketches and whiteboard diagrams, not just the card. These conversations need never be written down or archived, instead they are translated directly into automated tests and working code.

Using user stories in this way allows us to avoid 'analysis paralysis', the painful condition of trying to speculatively detail some far-future goal.

## Stories only work in an agile team

User stories are dependent on regular face-to-face communication between developers and customer representatives. Your product/service owner and other customer representatives need to be available to developers every day, and have sufficient time to think through and answer questions. Don't underestimate how time-consuming this work can be!
