#Running retrospectives
How and why we run retrospectives

##Guidance
A retrospective is a meeting at the end of a <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-service-design-manual/blob/master/Working%20in%20an%20agile%20way/structuringsprintcyclesandstandups.md">sprint</a> where the team get a chance to talk about what went well and badly in that sprint, and take some actions to improve matters. A retrospective can also be run to cover a larger scope, e.g. a full project retrospective.

- A retrospective takes the following form:
 - Gather data
 - Generate insights
 - Decide what to do

A retrospective should be a chance for everyone in the team to contribute to improving process/productivity.

It must be facilitated. Ideally the facilitator will be someone outside the team so the team can all contribute, but this is not essential. The facilator's role is to give everyone a chance to air their concerns and positive feedback while ensuring the meeting remains a structured, productive meeting and doesn't turn into just a moanfest.

The facilitator needs to:
 - ensure that everyone gets a chance to contribute
 - keep the retrospective on track
 - make sure actions are drawn out
 - manage time so that it does not run over

It is helpful to have some working agreements. These can be stated if necessary, for example in the first retrospectives a team has held. 
These might include:
 - Everyone contributes
 - Do not speak over each other (except for the facilitator)
 - No laptops - focus should be on the meeting

The outcome of a retrospective should be some actions that can be taken to improve the process - ideally for the next iteration, but certainly as soon.
Actions should:
 - be concrete and measurable (e.g. 'write 10 more unit tests for the redirector', or 'speak to Jamie about arranging a project retrospective'; not 'write more tests', or 'we should understand the lessons learned from this project')
 - have a date by which they should be completed
 - be assigned to a specific person (and not to 'the team')
 - should not be assigned to someone who is not present
Subsequent retrospectives should follow up on actions to make sure they have been done. If they are consistently not getting done, there may be too many.


##Code/Templates
A sample retrospective for a team of 8-10 for a two-week sprint might go as follows: 

For this number and scope 90 minutes is a reasonable length of time, and it is advisable to build in about 10% "shuffle time" to move between activites to ensure it doesn't overrun.
Each of the activities is timeboxed and it is up to the facilitator to make sure that this is adhered to.

Setting the scene	5 mins
Explaining the scope, and if necessary, purpose. 
If the team don't know each other and/or are shy, you could include a <a href="http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Check-in_Ideas">check in</a>/.

Actions from the previous retrospective 		5 mins
Make sure they have been completed. If not, find out why not. Do they still need to be done? If so, why have they not been? Set a new deadline if necessary, but it's not ideal to keep carrying actions over. 

Good				10 mins
Give the team around 10 minutes to write on post-its all the things that went well in the previous two weeks. 
If anonymity is important to encourage free expression, collect them in and add them to the wall yourself. If not, have the team take turns adding them.

Discussion			10 mins
Group the post-its and discuss the main areas. What should we keep doing? Why did those things go well and what can we learn? Are there any actions we can draw out?

Bad 				15 mins
Give the team around 15 minutes to do the same for anything that went badly.

Discussion 			20 mins
Again, group the post-its and discuss the main areas. Can we work out why these things went badly? Can we work out what we need to do to improve matters, or prevent specific things happening again? Can we draw out specific actions that someone here can take that will help?

Actions 			20 mins
Spend some time looking at the actions we have identified, assigning them to people present and setting realistic deadlines for completion.

Total: 80 mins with 10% shuffle time. It is OK to finish early if people have said what they need to. It is not OK to overrun - if there is too much to say, have the team prioritise the top areas for discussion.
