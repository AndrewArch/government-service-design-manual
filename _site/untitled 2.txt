Food safety data when you checkin on Foursquare

Food Alerts tries to tell you how the establishment you just checked in to on Foursquare fares on the UK Food Standards Agency's [six point Food Hygiene Rating scheme](http://ratings.food.gov.uk/) (before you place an order).

It uses the FSA's [open data API](http://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB) and matches them to places on Foursquare, then uses the [Pushover app](https://pushover.net/) for iphone and android to tell you the rating.
