#Transactional microcopy
<p>Microcopy includes the questions and common text you may use throughout a service. The suggested copy below has been tested on a number of transactions in the past and so is a good starting point for iterative testing of a new service. </p>

##Guidance
<p>Don’t use:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;please&rsquo; on labels - give polite, clear, short instruction
<li>colons after labels DESIGN
<li>&lsquo;y  our&rsquo; to labels etc, for example: your name, your address etc, use &lsquo;name&rsquo;, &lsquo;address&rsquo;, unless you have a page with multiple people where you need to differentiate - for example: &lsquo;your name&rsquo;, ‘partner name&rsquo; etc
</li>

<p>Use:</p>
<li>sentence case 
<li>address the user directly 
<li>the cap convention in the style guide [link]
</li>

<p>Style:</p>
<li>first name - not Christian name
<li>last name - not family name
<li>age
<li>date of birth - in full, not DOB
</li>

Help text - where is this going? Here? TALK TO DESIGN
Radio buttons - Yes/ No not Yes/no 
Keep to the same convention (yes first) all the way. You can pre-fill radio buttons (TALK TO DESIGN) if you expect at least 80% of users to answer questions in a certain way but keep to the yes/no format.


Optional/mandatory
DESIGN

##Code/Templates
