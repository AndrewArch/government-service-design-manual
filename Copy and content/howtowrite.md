##How to write

<p>This section gives details on naming your service, tone, style, questions and why we write in this way.</p>

<p>You may want to read: [how users read](link to other bit in github), this will tell you more about user reading behaviour - which will help when designing the content for your service.</p>

##Guidance
<p>All services should follow the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide). The way we talk to users is the same on all GOV.UK products. The only difference is the format.</p>

###Introductions
<p>Keep your sentences very specific, short, active (keeping the subject and verb close) and in plain English. Users won’t want to read anything at all on a tool or transaction. They will want to click, answer questions and get to the end as quickly as possible. It’s unlikely they will read much at all, so only tell them what you need to.</p>

###Titles
Service titles
<p>Don’t use terms like ‘my benefits’ etc. This will mean different things to different users. Some will think it is a list of all the benefits they have had, some will think it is an online account to manage benefits and others won’t know what to think. Don’t use puns or clever terms. Keep the service title clear, short and specific.</p>

###Page titles
<p>Keep page titles specific to the questions on the page. If the page is just about the user’s address, call it ‘your address’. Don’t call it ‘about you’. However, if you are covering a number of different elements of ‘about you’ on the page - you can. </p>

###Questions
<p>Make sure you need any question you include in your service. Don’t include questions that you think you might need later or for another part of your organisation. Keep the transaction as specific as possible to the task the user is trying to complete.</p>

##Tone and style

###Don’t use jargon  
<p>Jargon is used differently by different people, so you will be opening up the language to misinterpretation.</p>

###Spin
<p>We lose trust if we use spin or try to ‘convince’ a user of something. Give them the facts they need and don’t try to encourage. The facts should speak for themselves - if the information is clear enough, the user will make their own decision.</p>

###Subheads
<p>You use fewer eye muscles to look down than you do across. That might be why users prefer to scan down a page and not across.</p>

<p>By providing clear, specific subheads you are helping the user to scan the page and find the information they are looking for.</p>

<p>In tools and transactions, it’s unlikely you will have a lot of information to break up but if you do, use subheads. </p>

##Code/Templates
If you're giving people code, copy to cuta and paste then here is where it will go.</p>

##Why we do this
<p>GOV.UK is to open up government information and services to anyone who is interested or needs to interact with government.</p>

###Inclusive
<p>As government we need to be inclusive - we can do this through our design and language. By making the design open and easy to read, the code clean and accessible and the words easy to understand, we are opening up government to all. </p>

###Responsibility
<p>Citizens of the UK can’t go to anyone else for many of our services. Or if they do, to get a better, clearer experience, they usually have to pay for it.</p>

<p>If we make the information hard to read or the design so distracting or difficult that the user doesn’t understand what we are trying to say - they could end up doing it incorrectly or not doing it at all. This could lead to a fine. Or in very extreme cases, jail.</p>

<p>Good design and words isn’t a desire or an ‘aim’ - it is our responsibility.</p>
