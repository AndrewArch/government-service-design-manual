#Common actions
<p> Button labels matter - a lot. This is the one place on the page that tells your users they are closer to their goal. Here, you will find out common conventions and style guidance. </p>

<p>If the user doesn’t need to do something - it should be  a link. Buttons are for actions only.</p>

##Guidance/Tool
<p>Don’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>use technical terms -  use ‘delete all information’, not ‘form reset’
<li> OTHER STUFF
</li>


<p>Use:</p>
<ul>
<li>verbs and an active voice</li>
<li>sentence case</li>

Button labels
Start now - at the beginning of the service
Next - not forward, go etc
Save - if an action is to save and the user will stay on the same page (you will need to provide an action if this is the case)
Save and next - if a user needs to save to move forward
Save and close - if a user needs to save and leave the service
Finish - at the end of a service and you are taking them to their confirmation page 
Back - not previous etc

Note on ‘save’
Only tell the user about the action that will lead to a result. So if the action is to save a page and then move on to the next one, only tell the user ‘next’. Users will expect us to save their information anyway. Only highlight this information if it is really necessary.
(And then look at your service to include automatic save.)

Multiple buttons
If you have a number of actions on the page - make sure you are very clear. Don’t have similar actions too close. TALK TO DESIGN ABOUT THIS 

Finish/ clear - finish should be a button. Clear - as a secondary action - should be a link - DESIGN


##Code/Templates
If you're giving people code r copy to cuta and paste then here is where it will go.

##Why we do this
Users want the maximum amount of information in the shortest time. In a service, users are already more action-orientated than when expecting to read flat copy. They will want to click a button - it means they will be one step closer to finishing their task.

Eye tracking shows users are less likely to read long labels. We don’t want them to get the action wrong - that will lead to frustration so we need to be clear, informative and succinct.

Users look at the left of a box and then look for the label - or down the labels. Making labels short uses fewer eye muscles. This in turn, makes it easier for the user..
