Good digital services will make use digital analysts to continually monitor performance data, identify where potential improvements could be made and test the impact of new designs.

## The importance of analysts

The reason we hire skilled analysts is that high quality digital services continually develop and improve over time. Development doesnâ€™t stop once the service is operational. 

Once a service is live, analytics provide a key tool in understanding what behaviours users are exhibiting. Working with user insight colleagues who focus on the why of behaviour, they provide the business with vital data to help product managers make decisions about new releases and features. 

Their work will continue with each new release or feature prototype, and they form the conduit between the data generated by high volume services and the insight required to make product improvements.

* strong numerical skills
