##Why we do this
The reason we hire skilled analysts is that high quality digital services continually develop and improve over time. Development doesnâ€™t stop once the service is operational. Once a service is live, analytics provide a key tool in understanding what behaviours users are exhibiting. Working with user insight colleagues who focus on the why of behaviour, they provide the business with vital data to help product managers make decisions about new releases and features. It continues apace with new releases happening daily or even hourly. Analysts provide the conduit between the huge amounts of data generated by high volume services and the insight required by service managers to make product improvements. It is this key skill of distilling data into actionable insight that makes a good analyst.
