#Procuring consultants and specialists

[What follows is just a seed entry to cover a framework Louis Hyde is working on, which will come on stream in Summer 2013]

##Proposed Digital Procurement Framework

The proposed Digital Procurement Framework is currently being designed by GDS and GPS and following an OJEU is expected to be available to departments from the middle of 2013. This guide gives an overview of the proposed framework.

##What is the framework?

The Digital Procurement Framework is designed to give departments access to a wide range of suppliers of Digital Services. 

##The role of GDS

GDS will sit between departments and suppliers. They will ensure that there is a sufficient supply of companies with the right capabilities able to deliver digital capability where government does business. They do not deliver any digital services capability themselves. The list of suppliers available on the framework will be refreshed every 4 to 5 months  as technology and the market moves.

##What can I buy?

The digital procurement framework is expected to cover the following areas:

* Software engineering - development & support
* Digital product development
* Digital / agile transformation
* Proposition modelling
* Content / interaction design / user experience
* Testing / quality assurance
* Continuous integration, Web ops, Accreditation

##What other features are there?

* Procurement support for departments
* The provision of pre-engagement activities such as hack days, prototypes
* A portal for departments to enter and track their procurements
* Quick payments for suppliers

##Where does G-Cloud fit in?

G-Cloud’s focus is commodity services. This includes those Specialist Cloud Services that support cloud / commodity services and are themselves commodities. Hence, if a customer has a well-defined Agile need – say, for a small development project, or the early stages of a project – then G-Cloud and its rapid procurement processes are suitable.

##People over Process

An underlying principle behind agile development is that people are more important than process and throughout the digital ecosystem, it is proven that great teams make great products.

At GDS, we do not call people “resources”, whether permanent or contract. You look after people, resources are things you use (and discard!).

##Digital is a specialist skill

Some key roles will require a specialist, not a generalist - don’t try and squeeze a generalist into a specialist role, it will hurt you and them. In government, digital often becomes the responsibility of the communications team. While there are some complementary skills, there are unique requirements in each and you should struggle to find the best fit for the role required.

##How do you identify the skills you require?

* Service manager/product owner has a vision 
* Talk to others for steering and guidance
* Can GDS help you with your recruitment process - job specs, interviews etc?
* Product/Technical decisions will dictate the shape of your team - technical decisions are best made by technical people - allow the technical people in your team to make these decisions, don’t be scared
* Rely on experts in the field you are recruiting
* Nothing wrong with hiring individuals you know if they are the best fit for a particular skill, equally there’s nothing wrong with using a recruitment specialist to get the candidate you need.

##Working in a team

Achieving the right mix of contract versus permanent staff on your team will depend on your product.

Contractors should receive an induction and be thoughtfully integrated in team - where do they sit, who next to, how do they fit? Use some common sense, think about how long will this person be with you and tailor the induction accordingly. 

For example for the GOV.UK platform team, we hired a specialist search engine consultant to work with the team for two days. He worked with two permanent members of the team so they could learn from them. 
 
Skills transfer is vitally important, we can all learn from a specialist. But more importantly, don’t allow a contractor or consultant to become a single point of failure in your team. Knowledge must be shared for the maximum benefit.

For the good of your team and to get the best results from bringing in a specialist contractor, you should not treat them any differently from a permanent member of the team, they are people too. 

##Delivery Management

Some guiding principles:

* Make sure you have enough budget 
* Speak to your HR team and confirm you have the flexibility to negotiate salary etc, particularly for technical roles
* Shield your people from the form-filling culture that HR sometimes brings
* Contractors shouldn’t work from home all the time (be sensible here, the odd day won’t hurt)
* Monitoring the work through project tracking tools, but most importantly talk to your people and understand the work they’re doing
* Don’t forget, contractors can’t sign things!
