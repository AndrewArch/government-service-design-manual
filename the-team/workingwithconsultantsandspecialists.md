Consultants and specialists can help fill the gaps in capability you identify throughout your service's lifespan. However, the benefit of their skills and perspective can come with the challenge of procuring and inducting them.

## How do you identify the skills you require?

As the service manager or product owner's vision is shaped by the team, you may encounter areas where you lack the neccessary expertise to deliver to a  high standard. 

First, talk to your team and see if they can identify the skills lacking. If you find these can't be found within your wider department then it might be time to think about procuring specialists. You can talk to GDS and other service owners at any time for their advice on what to do next.

Trust domain experts to define what you need to be looking for. Developers and designers will be best placed to tell you what front end skills you need, for example. GDS can help provide guidance and job specifications if you need to further define the role.

If you know particular individuals are the best fit fot a particular skill then there's nothing wrong with hiring them. Equally there’s nothing wrong with using a recruitment specialist to get the candidate you need. Remember that the service will be judged on what it delivers, so you must have confidence that the specialists you recuit are the right people to deliver that work.


## Proposed Digital Procurement Framework

The Digital Procurement Framework is designed to give departments access to a wide range of suppliers of Digital Services. What follows is just a seed entry to cover a framework Louis Hyde is working on, which will come on stream in Summer 2013.

The proposed Digital Procurement Framework is being designed by GDS and GPS and following an OJEU is expected to be available to departments from the middle of 2013. This guide gives an overview of the proposed framework.

### The role of GDS

GDS will sit between departments and suppliers. They will ensure that there is a sufficient supply of companies with the right capabilities able to deliver digital capability where government does business. They do not deliver any digital services capability themselves. The list of suppliers available on the framework will be refreshed every 4 to 5 months  as technology and the market moves.

### Where does G-Cloud fit in?

[G-Cloud](http://gcloud.civilservice.gov.uk/)’s focus is commodity services. This includes those Specialist Cloud Services that support cloud / commodity services and are themselves commodities. Hence, if a customer has a well-defined Agile need – say, for a small development project, or the early stages of a project – then G-Cloud and its rapid procurement processes are suitable.

### What can I buy?

The digital procurement framework is expected to cover the following areas:
* software engineering - development & support
* digital product development
* digital / agile transformation
* proposition modelling
* content / interaction design / user experience
* testing / quality assurance
* continuous integration, Web ops, Accreditation

The framework will also feature:
* procurement support for departments
* the provision of pre-engagement activities such as hack days, prototypes
* a portal for departments to enter and track their procurements
* quick payments for suppliers


## Managing consultants and specialists

Achieving the right mix of contract versus permanent staff on your team will depend on your product.

Contractors should receive an induction and be thoughtfully integrated in team - where do they sit, who next to, how do they fit? Use some common sense, think about how long will this person be with you and tailor the induction accordingly. 

For example for the GOV.UK platform team, we hired a specialist search engine consultant to work with the team for two days. He worked with two permanent members of the team so they could learn from them. 
 
Skills transfer is vitally important, we can all learn from a specialist. But more importantly, don’t allow a contractor or consultant to become a single point of failure in your team. Knowledge must be shared for the maximum benefit.

For the good of your team and to get the best results from bringing in a specialist contractor, you should not treat them any differently from a permanent member of the team, they are people too. 

### People over Process

An underlying principle behind agile development is that people are more important than process and throughout the digital ecosystem, it is proven that great teams make great products.

At GDS, we do not call people “resources”, whether permanent or contract. You look after people, resources are things you use (and discard!).

### Guidance for a smooth induction

Some guiding principles for service managers or delivery managers:
* make sure you have enough budget 
* speak to your HR team and confirm you have the flexibility to negotiate salary etc, particularly for technical roles
* shield your people from the form-filling culture that HR sometimes brings
* contractors shouldn’t work from home all the time (be sensible here, the odd day won’t hurt)
* monitoring the work through project tracking tools, but most importantly talk to your people and understand the work they’re doing

And don’t forget, contractors can’t sign things!
