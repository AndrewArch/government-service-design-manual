## The importance of web operations

Web operations people (alternatives include systems administrators, operations engineers or site reliability engineers) are their to help run the eventual production systems, but also to help the development team build software that is easy to operate. Thinking about how the eventual system will be run at the very start of the project is important if you want to smoothly move from prototypes to production systems.

At a high level they will:

* Work with developers to optimise existing application and to design new ones
* Participate in stand-ups, planning sessions and retrospectives
* Design, build and run systems for application deployment, systems orchestration and configuration management
* Encourage everyone (developers, delivery managers, product owners) to think about how new applications will be run and maintained
* Contribute to designing internal processes needed in the running of a high performance development and operations organisation
* Help everyone understand constrains around security, performance, cost and resulting tradeoffs

## Skills

With specific skills:

* Deep understanding of the target operating system; Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.
* Experience of multiple programming languages
* Common deployment patterns
* Continuous integration
* Capacity planning
* Load and performance testing techniques
* Highly available systems design
* Administration and tuning of production database systems.
* Installation and usage of monitoring tools; for instance Nagios, Ganglia, Riemann, Graphite, etc.
* Knowledge of configuration, deployment and management of web application stacks
* Configuration management tools like Puppet, Chef, CFEngine

And ideally have an interest in or some experience with:

* EC2 or similar dynamic provisioning
* Compliance, auditing and security
* Open source development
* Experience in a product centric environment
