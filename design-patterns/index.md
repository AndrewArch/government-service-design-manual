Design patterns are reusable bits of web interface like form controls, navigation and calendars.

## How to use the patterns

Each pattern is specified as a bundle of HTML, JavaScript and CSS, with accompanying guidance on
their appropriate use.

All the code is available via the [Git repository for this site](). The CSS for each pattern 
is available in the Sass format and, where possible, mixins have been created to make using and
adapting the patterns as easy as possible.

All the patterns in the library make use of the [GOV.UK frontend toolkit](/templates-and-code/sass-repositories.html), so you'll need to have this installed as well.
