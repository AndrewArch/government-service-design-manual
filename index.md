  <p>
    <strong>The way we make government services is changing</strong>
    By 2014 all new government services must meet the new 'Digital by Default' standard.
    This manual explains what the standard is and shows you how to meet it.

  <h2>Lifecycle of a service</h2>

  <ul class="phases-promo">
    <li class="discovery">
      <h2>Discovery</h2>

      <p>The objective of this short phase is to gain an understanding of what the users of the service need, what the business requirements are and what technological or policy related constraints there might be.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="alpha">
      <h2>Alpha</h2>

      <p>The objective of this phase is to build a working prototype that can be used by stakeholders or a closed group of end users. This will enable you to trial technology and get early feedback on the design of the service.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="beta">
      <h2>Beta</h2>

      <p>The objective of this phase is to build a fully working prototype and make it available to all end users.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="live">
      <h2>Live</h2>

      <p>The objective of this phase is to provide a fully resilient service to all end users. The service should now meet all security and performance standards.</p>      
    </li>
