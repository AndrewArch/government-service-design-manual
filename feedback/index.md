Some guiding questions...

### The Standard

* Is 'the Standard' page enough to tell you about Digital by Default?
* What would you like to see in this area?
* We are considering providing a lens view so that information relevant to the role of person logged in is most prominently displayed. Would this be useful to you?
* This section could link through to relevant pieces of guidance. Is this something you would like to see? Or is there anything else you would require here?

### Guidance

* Is the guidance easy to navigate?
* Would you like to see the guidance structured in any other way?
* Is there any other guidance you want to see in the guidance?
* Would you like access to additional help from these pages?
