This website is a resource to help you and your team achieve the Digital by Default Standard. 

Remember, this site is an ‘alpha’ prototype. The guidance is incomplete, and shouldn’t yet be considered canonical.

## The Standard

The [Digital by Default standard](/digital-by-default) is a list of criteria that services and teams must meet before they go live. This list is very much under discussion, but it gives you a sense of what’s currently under consideration.

Creating a standard for services to meet was [one of the actions in the Government Digital Strategy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#initial-outline-of-proposed-digital-by-default-transactional-service-standard), and that includes things like basing development around users needs, iterating a service based on feedback, and making plans to meet key performance indicators.

The Digital by Default Service Standard will achieve two things. Consistently excellent digital government services. And teams across Government capable of designing, building and running them.

The [guides and toolkits](http://gsdm.herokuapp.com/handbook/) are a pool of knowledge about how to design and build digital services. It contains code and copy for people to reuse, as well as advice about how to build features and the reasons for it.

When it’s released, teams across government will be able to contribute new approaches and tools. For now it’s been populated by GDS staff. 

Not every heading is full of content - around half of the guidance has been returned at time of writing - but if you want to see good examples of guidance then take a look at the pages about [Colour palettes](/guides/colours).
