#Cookie Warnings
How and why we notify users about cookies on GOV.UK.

##Guidance
In line with European Law, we notify users whenever we use cookies on Government Services. 

This happens whenever users first visit GOV.UK, using the following banner:

>GOV.UK uses cookies to make the site simpler. [Find out more about cookies](https://www.gov.uk/support/cookies)

When a specific action sets a cookie, you will need to notify users. This will look like this: 

>[sets a cookie](https://www.gov.uk/support/cookies#)

That link will take users to the cookies page, and the appropriate description of the cookie being set.

##Why we do this
This cookies policy was devised following extensive research during the beta of GOV.UK. It followed the [The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1208/contents/made) (PECR). You can read more about how we decided this in [this blog post by GDS Developer Dafydd Vaughan](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/01/12/cookies-on-the-beta/).

#Using Cookies
This short guide tells you what to keep in mind when including cookies into your services.

##Guidance
Minimise the use of cookies throughout services. Store as little information as you require for as short a time as necessary to deliver a good service to users.

If your service requires new cookies to be set then you need to ensure that they can be explained simply and clearly, in a way that the majority of users can understand.

You will need to notify users whenever a specific action sets a cookie. This will look like this: 

>[sets a cookie](https://www.gov.uk/support/cookies#). 

That link will take users to the cookies page, and the appropriate description of the cookie being set.

##Code/Templates
On [the cookies page at GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/support/cookies) you can see a breakdown of the kinds of cookie used throughout the site, followed by an explanation of each cookie’s purpose. For example;

>###Storing your approximate location
>Some pages on this site provide you with information based on your location. So when you enter your postcode, we save your approximate location to a cookie. This means you don’t have to keep typing your postcode in, and means we’ll always point you towards services that are closest to you e.g. the nearest UK online centre.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>Purpose</td>
        <td>Expires</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>govukgeo</td>
        <td>Saves details about your location so that services which require this information are consistent</td>
        <td>4 months</td>
    </tr>
</table>

##Cookies on existing transactions

The GOV.UK cookies policy does not cover 3rd party transactions. Unfortunately, most existing transactions were built before the updated EU Privacy Directive came into force, so weren't built with it in mind (hence not having cookie policies). 

New and redesigned services will be expected to notify users that cookies are being set beforehand, using a 'sets a cookie' line of text near the action that triggers the cookie (this text should be linked to the appropriate part of the cookie information page).  You can see an example of how that works on GOV.UK here: https://www.gov.uk/dvla-offices

Where a user can't be notified before the cookie is set (i.e. if it's set when the user firsts visits the transaction using implied consent), the transaction should use a banner similar to that on GOV.UK to tell people that this is the case and link them to the further information.
