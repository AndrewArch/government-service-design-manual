#Transactional microcopy
<p>Microcopy includes the questions and common text you may use throughout a service.  </p>

##Guidance
**Don’t use**:

<li>&lsquo;please&rsquo; on labels - give polite, clear, short instruction
<li>colons after labels 
<li>Don&rsquo;t add &lsquo;your&rsquo; to labels etc, for example: your name, your address etc, use &lsquo;name&rsquo;, &lsquo;address&rsquo;, unless you have a page with multiple people where you need to differentiate - for example: &lsquo;your name&rsquo;, ‘partner name&rsquo; etc
</li>

**Use**:
<li>sentence case 
<li>address the user directly 
<li>the cap convention in the style guide [link]
</li>

**Style:**
<li>first name &ndash; not Christian name
<li>last name &ndash; not family name
<li>middle name(s)
<li>age
<li>date of birth - in full, not DOB
</li>

###Help text

<p>There are 3 levels of text:</p>
<strong>On-page help</strong>
<p>One line under the label that will help the user to fill in that field.</p>
<p>Examples: &lsquo;If you don't have your form XYZ rsquo; or &lsquo;Where to find your Unique Tax Reference Number.&rsquo;

<strong>Show/hide</strong>
<p>Use an expandable show/hide box for slightly more lengthy instructions. You can use statements and questions but don't use the first person.</p>
<p> Examples: &lsquo;If you want to apply for both of these benefits&rsquo; (in this instance, you can&rsquo;t and there is another process you have to go through.

<strong>Light box</strong>
<p>Only use a light box for help if you are explaining a concept or part of a process - don't use it for explaining any part of the service. If you need to explain how the service works with that much text, your design is probably wrong.</p>


###Radio buttons

<p>Use: Yes [button] No [button] (note caps)</p>
<p>Keep to the same convention (yes first) on the page.</p>

#Start and end of transaction pages


## What counts as a 'transaction'?

Transactional services are those that enable exchanges of information, money, rights or goods between two or more individuals. For GOV.UK this is typically between the government and the user of the service.

Simple exchanges of information, where no personal information about the user is stored by government, are not classed as transactions. For example, GOV.UK content formats like guides and smart answers are not classed as transactions.


## Transaction start pages

The start point for any GOV.UK transaction should be a page on the GOV.UK domain. Users should not be able to jump to a later page in the service via some other means (e.g. Google).

The design of the start page will be determined by the nature of the service and it's audience. All start pages should meet the following goals:

### Describe the service

The page should include the name of the service, expressed as an action if possible ('Renew your passport', Claim for disability allowance', 'Book a driving test' etc.). If you need to, include a very brief description of the service.

### Set expectations

People will tend to base their expectations of what a transaction involves on their experience of other digital transactions, for example, online shopping and banking.

If your service has features that do not match these expectations then you should inform your users of this as early on as possible, ideally on the start screen.

Users should be told about any financial costs or long waiting periods involved. If they'll be asked to provide relatively obscure information let them know so they can get it ready.

If there are specific eligibility requirements for the service let people know. If the eligibility requirements are complex you should consider using the Smart Answer format to help people understand whether or not they are eligible.

It's better to ask a few questions up front (and explain why you're doing this) than to let people invest time and effort in a transaction only to discover part way through that they're not eligible to use it.

## Transaction end pages

The end point of any transaction should be a page on the GOV.UK domain. These pages should:

1) Let the user know that they have successfully completed the transaction
2) If further actions are required, let the users know what they are
3) If no further actions are required, point users in the direction of other relevant information and services
