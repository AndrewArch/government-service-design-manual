#What is Assisted Digital?
A brief definition of what is meant by assisted digital. 

##Guidance
Action 9 of the Government Digital Strategy committed that, in the move to digital by default, 
we would put in place a cross-government approach to assisted digital support for the 18% of adults 
in the UK who are offline (never or very rarely use the internet) and for those who have limited digital capability.

Assisted digital support will meet the needs of citizens who face challenges of varying complexity 
in accessing public services digitally. The people who really need this support will still be able to 
access a service face to face, by phone, or in another appropriate non-digital way, with someone either 
inputting their data into the digital system on their behalf, or helping them put their data into the 
digital service themselves. This support will be designed around the specific needs of service users.

##Why we do this
Government recognises that citizens have different levels of digital capability and consequently 
will need different kinds of support depending on their ability and the type of digital transaction 
or service that is being accessed.  Good assisted digital support might also encourage and equip people 
to use the digital service independently in future. 

The aim is for public services to provide a high quality user experience digitally and become so 
straightforward and convenient that all those who can use them will do so, whilst those who canâ€™t are 
not excluded. Assisted digital support is the way that more challenged users will access the services 
they are entitled to and can do the things that government requires of them.
